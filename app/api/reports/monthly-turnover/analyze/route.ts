ðŸŽ¯ PROVIDE EXPERT ANALYSIS AS IF YOU'RE THEIR PERSONAL CFO:

1. **Seasonality & Market Trends**
   - Identify fitness industry seasonal patterns (New Year rush, summer drop-off, September resurgence)
   - Compare their performance to typical industry benchmarks
   - Highlight unexpected deviations from normal seasonality

2. **Peak Performance Analysis**
   - Which months consistently outperform and WHY (specific to fitness industry)
   - Are peaks driven by new member acquisition, existing member upgrades, or special promotions?
   - How to extend peak periods or replicate success

3. **Underperformance Diagnosis**
   - Identify low-revenue periods and root causes (churn, reduced acquisition, pricing issues)
   - Is this normal seasonal dip or concerning trend?
   - Specific tactics to shore up weak months

4. **Growth Trajectory & Health Metrics**
   - Overall business health: growing/stable/declining with evidence
   - Revenue predictability and stability analysis
   - Red flags or green flags in the data

5. **Strategic Recommendations (3-5 HIGH-IMPACT actions)**
   - Focus on: membership retention, front-end offers, back-end optimization, pricing strategy
   - Each recommendation must include:
     * Specific action they can take THIS MONTH
     * Expected revenue impact (quantified if possible)
     * Implementation difficulty and timeline
   - Prioritize by ROI potential

Industry benchmarks to reference:
- Typical gym retention: 70-80% annually
- New Year boost: 30-50% increase in Jan-Feb
- Summer dip: 15-25% decrease Jun-Aug
- Average revenue per member: Â£40-80/month (UK)
- Front-end to back-end ratio: Usually 30:70
