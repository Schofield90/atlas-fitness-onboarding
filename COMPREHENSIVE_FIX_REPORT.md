**Solution**: Added `/book/public` to middleware publicRoutes array
**File**: `middleware.ts`
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to production

### 2. Automation Builder - Node Persistence (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem**: Adding new nodes deleted previous ones

**File**: `app/components/automation/WorkflowBuilder.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Removed early return when ReactFlow instance is null
- Added fallback positioning when instance not available
- Nodes now properly append instead of replace

### 3. Automation Builder - Node Configuration (FIXED)
**Problem**: Clicking nodes deleted them instead of opening config
**Solution**: Modified click handler to open configuration panel on single click
**File**: `app/components/automation/WorkflowBuilder.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Single click now opens configuration panel
- Added event.stopPropagation() to prevent bubbling

### 4. Add Customer Page (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Solution**: Converted button to Link component
**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Now navigates to `/billing`
- Maintains styling and hover effects

### 7. Workflow Test Execution (IMPROVED)

**File**: `app/components/automation/WorkflowBuilder.tsx`
**Features**:
- Shows error if no trigger nodes exist
- Simulates workflow execution
- Displays execution steps with timing
