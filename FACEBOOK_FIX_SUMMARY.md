# Facebook Integration Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed (August 24, 2025)

### 1. ✅ Pages Display Error
**Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')`
**Solution**: 
- Updated API to return complete page data (followers_count, category, cover)
- Added null safety checks in frontend
- Made TypeScript interfaces properly optional
- Enriched database with page details from Facebook API

### 2. ✅ Ad Accounts Not Loading
**Problem**: Ad accounts API was looking for token in cookies instead of database
**Solution**:
- Updated `/api/integrations/facebook/ad-accounts/route.ts` to get token from database
- Added proper authentication with organization context
- Now fetches all 25 ad accounts successfully

### 3. ✅ Lead Forms Not Loading
**Problem**: Lead forms API was also using cookie-based authentication
**Solution**:
- Updated `/api/integrations/facebook/lead-forms/route.ts` to get token from database
- Added page access token retrieval from database
- Fixed organization context for proper data isolation

### 4. ✅ Authentication Issues
**Problem**: User wasn't properly associated with organization
**Solution**:
- Added user to organization_members table
- Fixed middleware to include /integrations routes
- Ensured proper RLS policies are respected
