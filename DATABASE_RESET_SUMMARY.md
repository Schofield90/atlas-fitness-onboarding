## 🧪 Testing the Complete Onboarding Flow

The database is now ready to test the full onboarding experience from scratch.

### Test Scenario 1: First-Time User (No Organization)

**Test URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk

**Login Credentials**:

- Email: `sam@gymleadhub.co.uk`
- Password: `@Aa80236661`

**Expected Flow**:

1. ✅ Login successful
2. ✅ Redirect to `/onboarding/create-organization` (because user has no org)
3. ✅ User fills out organization creation form:
   - Name: "Atlas Gym Test"
   - Industry: "Fitness"
   - Size: "1-10 employees"
4. ✅ Organization created with auto-generated slug: `atlas-gym-test-abc123`
5. ✅ Redirect to: `/org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/dashboard`
6. ✅ Dashboard loads with NEW path-based URL

### Test Scenario 2: Super Admin Can Access Any Org

**Steps**:

1. Create first org (from Scenario 1): `atlas-gym-test-abc123`
2. Logout
3. Create a second user account: `staff@test.com`
4. Create second org with second user: `second-gym-xyz456`
5. Logout from `staff@test.com`
6. Login as `sam@gymleadhub.co.uk` (SUPER ADMIN)
7. Try accessing second org: `/org/second-gym-xyz456/dashboard`

**Expected**:

- ✅ Sam can access `second-gym-xyz456` even though not a member
- ✅ Super admin bypass working

### Test Scenario 3: Staff Member Access (Restricted)

**Steps**:

1. Login as owner of `atlas-gym-test-abc123`
2. Create new user account: `trainer@test.com`
3. Add `trainer@test.com` as staff to `atlas-gym-test-abc123`
4. Logout
5. Login as `trainer@test.com`
6. Try accessing: `/org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/dashboard`
7. Try accessing: `/org/second-gym-xyz456/dashboard`

**Expected**:

- ✅ Can access `atlas-gym-test-abc123` (member)
- ❌ BLOCKED from `second-gym-xyz456` (not a member)
- ✅ Tenant isolation working correctly

### Test Scenario 4: Legacy URL Backward Compatibility

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/dashboard

**Login**: `sam@gymleadhub.co.uk`

**Expected**:

- ✅ Dashboard loads (legacy session-based routing)
- ✅ Shows first org found in `user_organizations` table
- ✅ OR redirects to `/onboarding/create-organization` if no orgs

### Test Scenario 5: Multi-Organization User

**Steps**:

1. Login as `sam@gymleadhub.co.uk`
2. Create first org: "Gym A" → `gym-a-abc123`
3. Create second org: "Gym B" → `gym-b-xyz456`
4. Navigate to: `/org/gym-a-abc123/dashboard`
5. Navigate to: `/org/gym-b-xyz456/dashboard`
6. Navigate to: `/dashboard` (legacy)

**Expected**:

- ✅ Can access both orgs via path-based URLs
- ✅ Path-based URLs allow explicit org selection
- ✅ Legacy `/dashboard` shows first org (session-based)

---

## 🔐 Current Authentication State

### Auth Users Remaining (3 users)

```sql
SELECT id, email, created_at, last_sign_in_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected users**:

1. `sam@gymleadhub.co.uk` (SUPER ADMIN)
2. `samschofield90@hotmail.co.uk` (Member portal user)
3. `sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk` (Staff dashboard user)

All users have NO organization associations now - they're in a clean state ready for fresh org creation.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Test New User Onboarding

```bash
# Recommended test flow
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Navigate to: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk
3. Login as: sam@gymleadhub.co.uk
4. Should redirect to: /onboarding/create-organization
5. Create organization
6. Verify redirect to: /org/{slug}/dashboard
```

### 2. Test Path-Based Routing

```bash
# After creating org with slug "atlas-gym-test-abc123"
1. Visit: /org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/dashboard ✅
2. Visit: /org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/customers ✅
3. Visit: /org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/leads ✅
4. Visit: /org/atlas-gym-test-abc123/settings ✅
5. Visit: /org/nonexistent-slug/dashboard ❌ (should block)
```

### 3. Test Super Admin Access

```bash
# Create org as user A, access as super admin (user B)
1. User A creates: /org/user-a-gym-123/dashboard
2. Logout
3. Login as sam@gymleadhub.co.uk (SUPER ADMIN)
4. Visit: /org/user-a-gym-123/dashboard
5. Should have full access ✅
```

### 4. Test Tenant Isolation

```bash
# Verify users can't access other orgs
1. User A creates: /org/gym-a/dashboard
2. User B creates: /org/gym-b/dashboard
3. Login as User A
4. Try accessing: /org/gym-b/dashboard
5. Should be blocked with 403 ❌
```

## 📊 Verification Queries

Run these queries to verify clean state:

```sql
-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;

-- Should return 3
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;

-- Should return sam@gymleadhub.co.uk
SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'sam@gymleadhub.co.uk';

-- Should return 0 (no users have org associations)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE organization_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_organizations;

-- Should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organization_staff;
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Scope

- ✅ Reset performed on: **DEV database** (`lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn`)
- ❌ **NOT performed on**: Production database (`yafbzdjwhlbeafamznhw`)

Production database still has:

- 2 organizations
- All existing data intact

### Data Safety

- ✅ All auth users preserved
- ✅ Database schema intact
- ✅ Functions and policies intact
- ✅ No user credentials lost

### Rollback

If you need to restore the previous state:

**Option 1**: Recreate organizations manually

```sql
-- The deleted orgs were:
-- 1. GymLeadHub Admin (slug: gymleadhub-admin)
-- 2. Atlas Fitness Harrogate (slug: atlas-fitness-harrogate-fr72ma)
```

**Option 2**: Restore from Supabase backup

```
Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups → Restore
```
