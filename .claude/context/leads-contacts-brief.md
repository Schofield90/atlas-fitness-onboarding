# Leads & Contacts Module - Comprehensive Context Brief
**Generated**: 2025-08-30T00:00:00Z  
**Module Status**: Partially Implemented - Core functionality exists, gaps in import/export

## 1. Module Overview

### Current State Analysis
The Leads & Contacts module in Atlas Fitness Onboarding is **functionally operational** but has significant gaps that prevent full CRM capability. The system currently operates as two separate but related modules:

**Leads Module** (`/app/leads/page.tsx`) - **Status: 75% Complete**
- ‚úÖ Lead listing with filtering, search, sorting
- ‚úÖ Add Lead functionality via modal
- ‚úÖ Lead scoring and temperature classification (hot/warm/lukewarm/cold)
- ‚úÖ Export functionality (client-side CSV)
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant organization isolation with RLS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Import functionality (UI complete, backend missing)
- ‚ùå No dedicated contacts page (despite "Leads & Contacts" title)
- ‚ùå No lead-to-customer conversion workflow

**Customers Module** (`/app/customers/page.tsx`) - **Status: 90% Complete**
- ‚úÖ Customer listing with comprehensive filtering
- ‚úÖ Add Customer functionality via dedicated page
- ‚úÖ Import/export functionality for customers
- ‚úÖ Customer status tracking (active/inactive/slipping_away)
- ‚úÖ Membership integration

### Key Architecture Insights
1. **Data Model**: System treats "Contacts" as conceptual union of `leads` table and `clients` table
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Proper organization_id scoping with RLS policies throughout
3. **AI Integration**: Lead scoring system with activity-based algorithms
4. **Security**: Organization isolation enforced at database and API levels

## 2. Current Functionality Gaps

### Critical Missing Features

#### Import System Backend (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Gap**: `/api/v2/leads/import` endpoint missing
- **UI Status**: Complete with field mapping, duplicate handling, preview
- **Backend Status**: Referenced but not implemented
- **Component**: `/app/components/leads/BulkImportModal.tsx` (409 lines, fully built)
- **Impact**: Users cannot bulk import leads despite having polished UI

#### Lead Detail Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Gap**: No individual lead detail pages or API endpoints
- **Missing**: `GET /api/leads/[id]` endpoint
- **Missing**: Lead detail page at `/leads/[id]`
- **Impact**: Cannot view/edit individual lead details beyond basic table row

#### Lead Conversion Workflow (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Gap**: No lead-to-customer conversion process
- **Missing**: `POST /api/leads/[id]/convert` endpoint
- **Missing**: Conversion UI workflow
- **Current**: Manual process or separate customer creation
- **Impact**: Breaks CRM workflow, leads don't naturally progress to customers

#### Unified Contacts View (LOW PRIORITY)
**Gap**: No true "contacts" page combining leads and customers
- **Current**: Separate `/leads` and `/customers` pages
- **UI Shows**: "Leads & Contacts" but no unified view
- **Impact**: Users must navigate between sections to manage all contacts

### API Endpoint Gaps

#### Missing Endpoints (Implementation Required)
```
POST /api/v2/leads/import          - Bulk import (HIGH PRIORITY)
GET /api/leads/[id]                - Lead details (MEDIUM)
POST /api/leads/[id]/convert       - Lead conversion (MEDIUM)
POST /api/leads/bulk-update        - Bulk operations (LOW)
GET /api/leads/activities          - Activity history (LOW)
POST /api/leads/[id]/assign        - Lead assignment (LOW)
```

#### Partially Implemented Endpoints
```
POST /api/leads/activities         - Referenced in UI, unclear implementation
GET /api/leads/scoring             - Referenced but may not exist
```
