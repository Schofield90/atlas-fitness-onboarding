- Use appropriate agent for specialized tasks
- Maintain consistent code patterns

### 3. Testing Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical workflows

### 4. Deployment
- Push to GitHub for Vercel deployment
- Run database migrations via Supabase
- Update environment variables as needed

## Current Priorities

   - Build A/B testing framework

3. **AI Lead Scoring**
   - Train scoring models
   - Real-time score updates
   - Predictive analytics dashboard

### üìã Medium Priority
1. **Payment Processing**
   - Complete Stripe Connect onboarding
   - Build payment forms
   - Invoice generation

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Task management
   - Activity feeds

3. **Mobile App**
   - React Native development
   - Push notifications
   - Offline support

### üí° Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Custom report builder
   - Predictive insights
   - Export functionality

2. **Fitness Integrations**
   - MyFitnessPal sync
   - Wearable device data

## Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack Rationale
- **Next.js 14**: Server components for performance, built-in API routes
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL with built-in auth, realtime, and storage
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design
- **React Flow**: Best-in-class workflow visualization
- **BullMQ**: Production-grade job queue for automation

### Design Principles
1. **Database-First**: Business logic in PostgreSQL via RLS and functions
2. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with runtime validation
3. **Multi-Tenant First**: Every feature considers organization isolation
4. **API Consistency**: Standardized response formats and error handling
5. **Performance**: Optimize for sub-second response times

### Security Considerations
- Row Level Security for all tenant data
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations
- Webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

## Quick Reference

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run database migrations
supabase migration up
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from database
npm run generate:types

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Key Files
- `/app/api/*` - API endpoints
- `/app/lib/supabase/*` - Database utilities
- `/app/components/*` - React components
- `/supabase/migrations/*` - Database migrations
- `/.claude/agents/*` - Specialized AI agents
- `/.claude/context/*` - Project context

## Working with Agents

When facing complex tasks, use the specialized agents:

```markdown
# Example: Adding a new integration
1. Consult API Integration Specialist for best practices
2. Have Database Architect design storage schema
3. Use Automation Workflow Architect for workflow nodes
4. Get AI Services Engineer input for intelligent features
```

Each agent has deep knowledge of their domain and understands the project context. They can work together on complex features that span multiple areas.
