# CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: DELETE/UPDATE Vulnerability

## The Vulnerability

**CRITICAL**: The application had a severe security vulnerability where users from one organization could DELETE or UPDATE data from ANY other organization by simply knowing or guessing the record ID.

### Example of Vulnerable Code:
```typescript
// DANGEROUS - No organization check!
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', leadId)
```

This means:
- A user from "Gym A" could delete all leads from "Gym B"
- A competitor could steal or modify customer data
- No audit trail of cross-organization access

## The Fix

### 1. Created Secure Helper Functions (`/app/lib/api/secure-delete.ts`)
- `secureDelete()` - Verifies organization ownership before deletion
- `secureUpdate()` - Verifies organization ownership before updates
- Returns 404 for both "not found" AND "not authorized" (prevents information leakage)

### 2. Enhanced Authentication (`/app/lib/api/auth-check-org.ts`)
- `requireAuthWithOrg()` - Gets user's organization ID from database
- Ensures every request has organization context
- Handles organization membership lookups

### 3. Database Migration (`/supabase/migrations/20250728_add_organization_to_leads.sql`)
- Added `organization_id` column to leads table
- Created organization-based RLS policies
- Updated indexes for performance

### 4. Updated API Routes (Secure Versions Created)
- `/app/api/leads/route-secure.ts` - All CRUD operations with org checks
- `/app/api/leads/[id]/route-secure.ts` - Single lead operations with org checks
- `/app/api/booking/book/route-secure.ts` - Booking operations with org checks

### 5. Security Tests (`/__tests__/security/organization-isolation.test.ts`)
- Comprehensive test suite verifying organization isolation
- Tests for SQL injection prevention
- Ensures cross-organization access is blocked

## Implementation Pattern

### Before (VULNERABLE):
```typescript
// Delete without checking organization
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', id)
```

### After (SECURE):
```typescript
// Use secure delete helper
const result = await secureDelete({
  table: 'leads',
  id: leadId,
  organizationId: user.organizationId,
  supabase
})
```

### Direct Query Pattern (Also Secure):
```typescript
// First verify ownership
const { data: existingRecord } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .select('id')
  .eq('id', id)
  .eq('organization_id', user.organizationId)
  .single()

if (!existingRecord) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Not found' }, { status: 404 })
}

// Then delete with organization check
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', id)
  .eq('organization_id', user.organizationId)
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. **Update Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Ensure proper Supabase keys are set
   - Verify RLS is enabled on all tables

3. **Replace Vulnerable Routes**:
   - Rename current routes to `.old`
   - Rename `-secure.ts` files to replace originals
   - Test thoroughly before deploying

4. **Run Security Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test __tests__/security/organization-isolation.test.ts
   ```

## Prevention Going Forward

1. **Always Include Organization Checks**:
   - Every DELETE must check `organization_id`
   - Every UPDATE must check `organization_id`
   - Every SELECT should filter by `organization_id`

2. **Use Helper Functions**:
   - Use `secureDelete()` for all deletions
   - Use `secureUpdate()` for all updates
   - Use `requireAuthWithOrg()` for authentication

3. **Code Review Checklist**:
   - [ ] Does DELETE include organization check?
   - [ ] Does UPDATE include organization check?
   - [ ] Does SELECT filter by organization?
   - [ ] Are UUIDs validated before use?
   - [ ] Is user input properly validated?

4. **Database Best Practices**:
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Create policies that check organization
   - Add organization_id to all tables that need isolation

## Why This Wasn't Included Initially

This vulnerability likely occurred because:
1. Initial development focused on single-tenant functionality
2. Multi-tenant security was added later without updating all endpoints
3. RLS policies were checking `user_id` instead of `organization_id`
4. No security audit was performed on the DELETE/UPDATE operations

## Impact if Not Fixed

Without this fix:
- **Data Breach**: Competitors could access customer data
- **Data Loss**: Malicious users could delete all data
- **Legal Issues**: GDPR/Privacy law violations
- **Business Impact**: Complete loss of customer trust

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Try to delete a lead from another organization (should fail)
2. Try to update a lead from another organization (should fail)
3. Try to view leads from another organization (should not appear)
4. Run the security test suite

This is a **CRITICAL** fix that must be deployed immediately to production.
