## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

### **Starting the Queue System**

```bash
# Development mode
npm run queue:dev

# Production mode  
npm run queue:prod

# Generic start
npm run queue:start
```

### **Basic Usage Examples**

```typescript
import { QueueUtils } from '@/app/lib/queue';

// Trigger a workflow
await QueueUtils.triggerWorkflow('org_123', 'lead_created', leadData);

// Send email
await QueueUtils.sendEmail('org_123', {
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  template: 'welcome'
});

// Schedule bulk SMS
await QueueUtils.scheduleBulkCommunication('org_123', 'sms', recipients, template);

// Get system health
const health = await QueueUtils.getSystemHealth();
```

### **Monitoring**

- **Dashboard**: Access the queue monitor at `/components/queue/QueueMonitor`
- **API Health**: `GET /api/queues/health` 
- **Queue Stats**: `GET /api/queues/stats`
- **Health Check**: `POST /api/queues/health` with `{"action": "health-check"}`

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### **Environment Variables Required**

```bash
# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_password

# Database
