# Booking System Fix - Status Report

_Last Updated: September 7, 2025_

## üî• Critical Issue Summary

The booking system was failing due to a dual customer architecture conflict where the system has both `leads` and `clients` tables, but bookings only supported `customer_id` (leads). This caused foreign key constraint violations when trying to book clients.

## ‚úÖ What We've Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- **Added `client_id` column** to bookings table to support both customer types
- **Made `customer_id` nullable** to allow either client_id OR customer_id
- **Added constraint** ensuring exactly one of customer_id or client_id is set
- **Created indexes** for performance on client_id, customer_id, and organization_id
- **Fixed RLS policies** to allow public booking creation

**Migration Applied:** `/supabase/migrations/20250918_fix_booking_client_support.sql`

### 2. Cleaned Up Data Issues

- **Removed phantom bookings** for Sam Schofield that were blocking new bookings
- **Deleted invalid bookings** with NULL class_session_ids
- **Fixed membership display** by correcting column references

### 3. Frontend Updates Made

- **SingleClassBookingModal.tsx** - Updated to detect and handle both customer types
- **MultiClassBookingModal.tsx** - Fixed membership fetching and dual customer support
- **RecurringBookingModal.tsx** - Added dual customer support
- **All booking modals** now properly set either customer_id or client_id based on customer type

## üö® Issues We Encountered

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Violations

```
Error: insert or update on table "bookings" violates foreign key constraint "bookings_customer_id_fkey"
```

- Bookings were trying to use customer_id for clients who only exist in clients table
- **Solution:** Added client_id column and updated booking logic

### 2. Schema Cache Issues

```
Error: Could not find the 'client_id' column of 'bookings' in the schema cache
```

- Production database schema was out of sync
- **Solution:** Applied migrations through Supabase dashboard

### 3. Phantom Bookings

- Sam Schofield had bookings with NULL/invalid class_session_ids preventing new bookings
- Modal showed "You have already booked in for this class" incorrectly
- **Solution:** Cleaned up invalid bookings via SQL

### 4. Connection Errors

```
net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED
```

- Database was rejecting inserts due to missing client_id column
- **Solution:** Applied migration to add client_id support

## üìã What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Test booking flow end-to-end** on the new machine
   - Book a client to a class
   - Book a lead to a class
   - Verify membership usage updates
   - Test package usage updates

2. **Monitor for errors** in production
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Verify no more foreign key violations
   - Ensure RLS policies aren't blocking legitimate access

3. **Update other booking-related features**
   - Class attendance tracking
   - Booking cancellations
   - Waitlist functionality
   - Booking history views

### Future Improvements

1. **Data Architecture Consolidation**
   - Consider merging leads and clients tables into unified customers table
   - Would eliminate dual customer complexity permanently

2. **Add TypeScript Types**
   - Create proper types for dual customer system
   - Update API endpoints to use consistent typing

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for booking failures
   - Loading states during booking creation
   - Success confirmations with booking details

## üîß How to Test

### 1. Test Client Booking

```javascript
// Find a client in the Members page
// Click "Book Class" button
// Select a class and payment method
// Confirm booking
// Verify booking appears in database
```

### 2. Test Lead Booking

```javascript
// Find a lead in the Leads page
// Click "Book Class" button
// Select a class and payment method
// Confirm booking
// Verify booking appears in database
```

### 3. Verify Database State

```sql
-- Check bookings for clients
SELECT id, client_id, customer_id, booking_status
FROM bookings
WHERE client_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check bookings for leads
SELECT id, client_id, customer_id, booking_status
FROM bookings
WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Dual customer architectures require careful handling** - Having both leads and clients tables creates complexity that ripples through the entire system

2. **Schema migrations must be applied properly** - Direct SQL isn't enough; use Supabase dashboard for production changes

3. **RLS policies can block legitimate operations** - Always test with both authenticated and public access

4. **Invalid data can cause confusing errors** - Phantom bookings with NULL foreign keys created false "already booked" messages

## üöÄ Next Steps on New Machine

1. **Pull latest changes**

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Check migration status**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Migrations
   - Verify `20250918_fix_booking_client_support.sql` is applied

3. **Test booking functionality**
   - Try booking a client
   - Try booking a lead
   - Check console for any errors

4. **If issues persist**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check Supabase logs for database errors
   - Verify RLS policies aren't blocking access

## üìû Support Notes

If booking still fails:

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Look in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Database for query errors
3. Verify the client/lead exists in the correct table
4. Ensure class_session_id is valid

The core issue (dual customer architecture) is now fixed. Any remaining issues are likely caching or data-specific problems.
