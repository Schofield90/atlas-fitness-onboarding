## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED

### üî¥ Priority 1: Rotate Exposed Supabase Service Role Key

**Issue**: Service role key was exposed in Git history via `scripts/check-prod-clients.js`

**Exposed Key** (last 10 chars): `...CJqiWZw`

**Action**:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/yafbzdjwhlbeafamznhw/settings/api
2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Service Role Key
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Update `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable in all 3 Vercel projects:
   - atlas-fitness-member-portal
   - atlas-fitness-staff-dashboard
   - atlas-fitness-admin-portal
5. Redeploy all 3 projects after updating environment variables

**Risk**: Anyone with the exposed key has full admin access to production database until key is rotated.

### üü† Priority 2: Apply Database Migration to Production

**Current State**: Migration tested and working on dev database (`lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn`)

**Action**: Apply migration to production database via Supabase Dashboard

**Steps**:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/yafbzdjwhlbeafamznhw/editor
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
3. Copy contents of `/supabase/migrations/20251004_prepare_path_based_tenancy.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify functions created:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name
   FROM information_schema.routines
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
   AND routine_name LIKE '%org%slug%';
   ```
   Expected output:
   - `verify_org_access_by_slug`
   - `get_organization_by_slug`

**Why Required**: New middleware calls `verify_org_access_by_slug()` which doesn't exist in production yet. Until applied:

- New path-based URLs (`/org/{slug}/dashboard`) will fail with function not found error
- Legacy URLs (`/dashboard`) will continue to work normally

**Risk if not applied**: Path-based routing won't work, but legacy routing maintains backward compatibility.

### üü° Priority 3: Test in Production

Once the database migration is applied, test the following scenarios:

#### Test 1: Legacy URL (Should Still Work)

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/dashboard

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Dashboard loads normally (backward compatibility)

**Login**:

- Email: sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk
- Password: @Aa80236661

#### Test 2: Path-Based URL (NEW - Should Work After Migration)

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/org/atlas-fitness-harrogate-fr72ma/dashboard

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Dashboard loads with organization context

**Login**: Same as above

#### Test 3: Super Admin Access to Any Org

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/org/atlas-fitness-harrogate-fr72ma/dashboard

**Login**:

- Email: sam@gymleadhub.co.uk (SUPER ADMIN)
- Password: @Aa80236661

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Access granted to any organization (super admin bypass)

#### Test 4: Unauthorized Org Access (Should Fail)

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/org/gymleadhub-admin/dashboard

**Login**:

- Email: sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk (NOT a member of gymleadhub-admin)
- Password: @Aa80236661

**Expected**: ‚ùå 403 Forbidden or redirect to `/dashboard`

#### Test 5: Invalid Org Slug (Should Fail)

**URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/org/nonexistent-org-123/dashboard

**Expected**: ‚ùå 404 Not Found or redirect to `/dashboard`

---

## üîç What's Working Right Now

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional (Legacy Mode)

All existing URLs and functionality remain unchanged:

- `/dashboard` ‚Üí Works (session-based org detection)
- `/customers` ‚Üí Works
- `/leads` ‚Üí Works
- `/settings` ‚Üí Works
- All 766 API routes ‚Üí Work as before
- All 323 pages ‚Üí Work as before

**No breaking changes** - The deployment is backward compatible.

### ‚è≥ Partially Functional (Path-Based Mode)

Path-based URLs (`/org/{slug}/...`) are:

- **Code**: ‚úÖ Deployed
- **Middleware**: ‚úÖ Live
- **Database**: ‚ùå Functions missing in production

**Current behavior**:

- Attempting to access `/org/{slug}/dashboard` ‚Üí 500 Error ("function verify_org_access_by_slug does not exist")
- Middleware tries to call database function that doesn't exist yet

Once database migration is applied ‚Üí Full path-based routing will work.

## üìä Deployment Verification

### Check Vercel Deployment Status

```bash
# Check deployment status for all projects
npx vercel ls

# View deployment logs
npx vercel logs --app atlas-fitness-staff-dashboard
npx vercel logs --app atlas-fitness-member-portal
npx vercel logs --app atlas-fitness-admin-portal
```

### Monitor Production Errors

After deployment, monitor for errors related to the new middleware:

1. Check Vercel dashboard for each project
2. Look for errors containing:
   - `verify_org_access_by_slug`
   - `organization_id`
   - `x-org-slug`

**Expected errors before database migration**:

- `function verify_org_access_by_slug(text, uuid) does not exist`

**Expected after database migration**:

- No errors related to org access

## üîí Security Status

### ‚úÖ Security Improvements

1. **Exposed Key Remediated**:
   - Files removed from repository
   - Added to `.gitignore`
   - Git history cleaned (force pushed)
   - **Action required**: Rotate key in Supabase dashboard

2. **Enhanced Access Control**:
   - Path-based URLs make org access explicit
   - Super admin bypass properly implemented
   - Access verification via database functions

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - No breaking changes to existing security model
   - RLS policies remain unchanged
   - Session-based auth still works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Security Tasks

1. **Key Rotation**: Must rotate exposed service role key
2. **E2E Security Testing**: Test tenant isolation with new routing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting on middleware access checks

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise, rollback procedure:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Vercel Only)

```bash
# Revert to previous deployment on Vercel
npx vercel rollback <deployment-url> --app atlas-fitness-staff-dashboard
npx vercel rollback <deployment-url> --app atlas-fitness-member-portal
npx vercel rollback <deployment-url> --app atlas-fitness-admin-portal
```

### Option 2: Full Rollback (Git + Vercel)

```bash
# Checkout backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-path-tenancy-20251004-174725

# Force push to main (ONLY IF EMERGENCY)
git push origin backup/pre-path-tenancy-20251004-174725:main --force
```

### Option 3: Database Rollback

```sql
-- Remove new functions (safe - doesn't affect data)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS verify_org_access_by_slug(TEXT, UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_organization_by_slug(TEXT);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS log_slug_changes();
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS organization_slug_audit ON organizations;
```

**Note**: Database rollback is safe - only removes new functions, doesn't modify any existing data or indexes.
