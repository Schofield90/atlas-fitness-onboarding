- Google/Facebook OAuth credentials

## Technical Debt & Observations

1. **Multiple UI Implementations**: Different booking UIs suggest iterative development
2. **Debug Routes**: Extensive debug endpoints indicate active development/troubleshooting
3. **Migration Complexity**: 40+ migrations suggest evolving requirements
4. **Feature Flags**: No centralized feature flag system
5. **Test Coverage**: Limited test files found

## Recommendations

1. **Consolidate Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect actual state
2. **Clean Up Debug Routes**: Move to separate debug module
3. **Implement Feature Flags**: For safer feature rollouts
4. **Add Comprehensive Tests**: Especially for critical paths
5. **Optimize Migrations**: Consider consolidating older migrations
6. **Standardize UI Components**: Reduce duplicate implementations

## Next Steps

1. Run any pending database migrations
2. Configure all required environment variables
3. Set up Redis for queue management
4. Test core features in local environment
5. Create development data seeders
6. Document actual API endpoints
7. Create integration test suite

## Conclusion

The Atlas Fitness Onboarding platform is a sophisticated, production-ready SaaS application with extensive features already implemented. The codebase shows signs of active development and iteration, with robust multi-tenant architecture and comprehensive integrations. While there are areas for improvement, the platform provides a solid foundation for a gym management and lead generation system.
