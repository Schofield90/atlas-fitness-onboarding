# Signup Trigger Fix - Code Diff

## Changed Function: `handle_new_user()`

### Key Changes

#### 1. Added RLS Bypass (Beginning of Function)

```diff
 DECLARE
   new_org_id UUID;
   org_name TEXT;
   org_slug TEXT;
   user_role TEXT;
 BEGIN
+  -- Set local session to bypass RLS for this transaction
+  -- This is safe because the function is SECURITY DEFINER and runs as postgres
+  PERFORM set_config('request.jwt.claims', '{"role":"service_role"}', true);
+
   -- Extract organization name from metadata
   org_name := COALESCE(
     NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'organization_name',
```

#### 2. Fixed Users Table Insert (Removed Settings Column)

```diff
   -- Create user record in public.users
   INSERT INTO public.users (
     id,
     organization_id,
     email,
     name,
     role,
     avatar_url,
-    settings,  -- ❌ REMOVED: This column doesn't exist
     created_at,
     updated_at
   )
   VALUES (
     NEW.id,
     new_org_id,
     NEW.email,
     COALESCE(
       NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name',
       NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
       split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1)
     ),
     user_role,
     NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url',
-    '{}'::jsonb,  -- ❌ REMOVED: Value for non-existent column
     NOW(),
     NOW()
   );
```

#### 3. Organizations Insert (Unchanged - Already Correct)

```sql
-- Organizations table DOES have a settings column, so this is correct:
INSERT INTO public.organizations (
  name,
  slug,
  email,
  owner_id,
  subscription_plan,
  subscription_status,
  settings,  -- ✅ This is correct - organizations table has this column
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
VALUES (
  org_name,
  org_slug,
  NEW.email,
  NEW.id,
  'free',
  'trial',
  '{"onboarding_completed": false}'::jsonb,
  NOW(),
  NOW()
)
```

## Summary of Changes

| Component                 | Before                    | After                   | Status |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| RLS Bypass                | ❌ Missing                | ✅ Added `set_config()` | Fixed  |
| Organizations Insert      | ✅ Correct (has settings) | ✅ Unchanged            | OK     |
| Users Insert              | ❌ Had settings column    | ✅ Removed settings     | Fixed  |
| user_organizations Insert | ✅ Correct                | ✅ Unchanged            | OK     |

## Why This Fixes The Issue

### Before (Broken)

```
1. Auth user created
2. Trigger fires
3. Try to insert into organizations → ❌ RLS blocks
   OR
4. Try to insert into users → ❌ Column "settings" doesn't exist
5. Exception caught, user created but no org/profile
6. User can't log in (no organization)
```

### After (Fixed)

```
1. Auth user created
2. Trigger fires
3. Set JWT claims to service_role
4. Insert into organizations → ✅ RLS bypassed
5. Insert into users → ✅ No settings column error
6. Insert into user_organizations → ✅ Link created
7. User can log in with full access
```

## Error Messages

### Before Fix

```
new row violates row-level security policy for table 'users'
-- OR --
column "settings" of relation "users" does not exist
```

### After Fix

```
(No errors - silent success)
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix

```sql
INSERT INTO auth.users (...) VALUES (...);
-- Result: User created but trigger fails
SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE owner_id = new_user_id;
-- Returns: 0 rows ❌
```

### After Fix

```sql
INSERT INTO auth.users (...) VALUES (...);
-- Result: User created and trigger succeeds
SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE owner_id = new_user_id;
-- Returns: 1 row ✅
```
