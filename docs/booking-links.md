# Booking Links Guide

The booking links module provides comprehensive management of shareable booking links with routing corrections and toast notification feedback.

## Quick Start

Navigate to `/booking-links` to manage your booking links or `/booking-links/create` to create new ones.

## Fixed Routing Issues

### Corrected Navigation Paths
- **"Create Booking Link"** now correctly routes to `/booking-links/create` 
- **"Manage Links"** now correctly routes to `/booking-links` main page
- Fixed from incorrect routing: `/calendar?tab=booking-links` (old) â†’ `/booking-links` (new)

### Where Routes Lead
- **From Booking Page**: Links in quick stats tile direct to `/booking-links`
- **From Empty State**: "Create Booking Link" button routes to `/booking-links/create` 
- **From Calendar**: Booking Links navigation corrected to proper page
- **From Dashboard**: Quick action buttons use direct routing instead of modal parameters
