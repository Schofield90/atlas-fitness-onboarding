# Atlas Fitness CRM - Fixes Summary (August 27, 2025)

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes all fixes implemented on August 27, 2025, for the Atlas Fitness CRM platform. A total of **22 issues** were resolved, including 1 critical security fix, 8 high-priority UX fixes, and comprehensive test coverage added.

## Critical Security Fix

### ðŸ”´ Multi-Tenancy Organization Isolation
**Issue**: Hard-coded organization ID in leads import causing data isolation breach  
**Location**: `/app/leads/page.tsx:191`  
**Fix**: Replaced hard-coded ID with dynamic organization context from authenticated user  
**Impact**: Each organization now only sees their own data - critical for multi-tenant security  

## High Priority Fixes

### 1. Billing Page Error Handling
**Before**: "Failed to load billing information" raw error  
**After**: Friendly loading spinner and retry button on errors  
**Testing**: Navigate to `/billing` - should see proper loading states  

### 2. Staff Management Errors
**Before**: Technical error "Failed to fetch staff members"  
**After**: User-friendly message "Unable to load staff data. Please try again."  
**Testing**: Visit `/staff-management` - errors now human-readable  

### 3. Conversations - New Button
**Before**: No way to start new conversations  
**After**: "New Conversation" button in header that switches to enhanced view  
**Testing**: Click button on `/conversations` page  

### 4. Forms Category Expansion
**Before**: Category cards were static, couldn't see forms inside  
**After**: All categories expandable with chevron indicators and smooth animations  
**Testing**: Click on Waivers, Contracts, Health Forms, or Policies cards  

### 5. Lead Export Feedback
**Before**: Silent export with no user feedback  
**After**: Toast notifications: "Preparing export..." â†’ "Export completed successfully"  
**Testing**: Click Export on `/leads` page  

### 6. Call Bookings Routing
**Before**: "Create Booking Link" opened calendar modal  
**After**: Correctly navigates to `/booking-links/create`  
**Testing**: Click buttons on `/booking` page  

### 7. Campaigns View/Edit
**Before**: Buttons disabled by feature flags  
**After**: Fully functional view and edit capabilities  
**Testing**: Click eye/edit icons on campaign rows  

### 8. Surveys Edit/Delete
**Before**: Buttons disabled by feature flags  
**After**: Edit and delete functions work properly  
**Testing**: Click edit/delete icons on survey rows
