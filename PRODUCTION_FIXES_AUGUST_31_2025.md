# Production Fixes - August 31, 2025

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical production issues affecting workflow automation, staff management, and customer creation systems.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Workflow Automation Node Configuration Error ✅
**Problem:** When clicking on nodes in the automation builder to edit their settings, users encountered a "ReferenceError: config is not defined" error.

**Root Cause:** Direct reference to `config.pageId` in DynamicConfigPanelEnhanced.tsx without proper null checking.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `/app/components/automation/config/DynamicConfigPanelEnhanced.tsx`
- Changed direct `config.pageId` references to `dynamicData?.config?.pageId` with optional chaining
- Added proper null checks throughout the component

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/components/automation/config/DynamicConfigPanelEnhanced.tsx` (lines 169, 176, 786)

**Status:** Fixed, tested with Playwright, and deployed to production

### 2. Missing Instructors/Staff Display ✅
**Problem:** Staff members were not appearing on the staff management page despite existing in the database.

**Root Cause:** API was only querying 'organization_staff' table, but data existed in 'staff' table.

**Solution:**
- Updated `/app/api/staff/route.ts` to query both 'staff' and 'organization_staff' tables
- Combined results from both tables with proper deduplication
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Status:** Fixed and deployed

### 3. Customer Creation "address_line_1" Column Error ✅
**Problem:** Creating new customers failed with "Could not find the 'address_line_1' column" error.

**Root Cause:** Schema mismatch between base clients table and expected columns.

**Solution:**
- Created migration `/supabase/migrations/20250830_fix_clients_organization_column.sql`
- Updated `/app/customers/new/page.tsx` with fallback logic
- Added metadata field storage for missing columns
- Fixed org_id vs organization_id column naming inconsistency

**Status:** Fixed and deployed

## Testing Performed

### Playwright Automation Testing
1. Navigated to automation builder
2. Dragged Facebook Lead Form node to canvas
3. Clicked node to open configuration
4. Verified configuration panel opens without errors
5. Confirmed all form fields render correctly

### Manual Verification
- ✅ Staff page displays all instructors
- ✅ Customer creation works with address fields
- ✅ Automation node editing functions properly
