# GoTeamUp Import Bug Fixes - October 6, 2025

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical bugs in the GoTeamUp membership import feature that prevented memberships from being created and caused duplicate client records.

**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED
**Test Environment**: Production (organization_id: ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4)
**Test URL**: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/dashboard/import

## Critical Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Bug #1: Wrong Column Name for Clients Table ❌→✅

**Problem**:
- Code used `organization_id` but database schema uses `org_id`
- Affected lines: 151, 344, 1273 in `goteamup-import.ts`

**Impact**:
- Client duplicate check failed (always returned 0 results)
- Client lookups for membership assignment failed
- Caused duplicate client creation
- Prevented membership assignment (couldn't find clients)

**Fix**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
.eq("organization_id", this.organizationId)

// AFTER (CORRECT):
.eq("org_id", this.organizationId)
```

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts` (lines 151, 344, 1273)

---

### Bug #2: Wrong Table Name for Memberships ❌→✅

**Problem**:
- Code used `customer_memberships` table but database has `memberships` table
- Affected lines: 1352, 1366, 1399 in `goteamup-import.ts`

**Impact**:
- All membership inserts failed silently (table doesn't exist)
- 0 memberships created from imports
- No error messages shown to user

**Fix**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
.from("customer_memberships")

// AFTER (CORRECT):
.from("memberships")
```

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts` (lines 1352, 1366, 1399)

---

### Bug #3: Wrong Column Names in Membership Insert ❌→✅

**Problem**:
- Code tried to insert columns that don't exist in `memberships` table:
  - `custom_price_pennies`
  - `custom_price`
  - `price_override_reason`
  - `billing_source`
  - `billing_paused`
  - `payment_status`
  - `payment_provider`
  - `next_billing_date`

**Impact**:
- Even after fixing table name, inserts would still fail
- Database rejected unknown columns

**Fix**:
Simplified insert to only use columns that exist in the `memberships` table schema:
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
{
  client_id: client.id,
  organization_id: this.organizationId,
  membership_plan_id: planId,
  status: status === "active" ? "active" : "inactive",
  payment_status: "current",
  payment_provider: "manual",
  start_date: lastPaymentDate || new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0],
  next_billing_date: lastPaymentDate || null,
  custom_price_pennies: hasCustomPrice ? clientPricePennies : null,
  custom_price: hasCustomPrice ? lastPaymentAmount : null,
  price_override_reason: priceOverrideReason,
  billing_source: "goteamup",
  billing_paused: false,
  metadata: { ... },
}

// AFTER (CORRECT):
{
  customer_id: client.id,
  organization_id: this.organizationId,
  membership_plan_id: planId,
  status: status === "active" ? "active" : "inactive",
  start_date: lastPaymentDate || new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0],
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
}
```

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts` (lines 1387-1395)

---

### Bug #4: Missing Error Logging ❌→✅

**Problem**:
- `importMemberships()` method had no console.log statements
- Errors were caught but not logged
- Impossible to debug why imports were failing

**Impact**:
- No visibility into import failures
- Required database inspection to find issues
- Wasted developer time debugging

**Fix**:
Added comprehensive logging at every phase:
```typescript
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Loading all clients for org ${this.organizationId}`);
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Loaded ${allClients?.length || 0} clients`);
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Checking for existing membership for client ${client.id}, plan ${planId}`);
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Creating new membership for client ${client.id}, plan ${planId}`);
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Inserting membership:`, membershipData);
console.log(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Successfully created membership ${newMembership[0]?.id}`);
console.error(`[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Error creating membership:`, membershipError);
```

**Files Changed**:
- `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts` (lines 1269-1280, 1350-1415)

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing (Production)

1. **Login to Dashboard**
   ```
   URL: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/signin
   Email: sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk
   Password: @Aa80236661
   ```

2. **Navigate to Import Page**
   ```
   https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/dashboard/import
   ```

3. **Test Client Import First**
   - Upload a clients CSV (must include: Email, Full Name, First Name, Last Name)
   - Verify clients are created without duplicates
   - Check browser console for `[CLIENT-IMPORT]` logs

4. **Test Membership Import**
   - Upload `/test-memberships.csv`
   - Verify membership plans are created
   - Verify memberships are assigned to clients
   - Check browser console for `[MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT]` logs

5. **Expected Console Output**
   ```
   [MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Loading all clients for org ee1206d7-...
   [MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Loaded 205 clients
   [MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Checking for existing membership for client ...
   [MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Creating new membership for client ...
   [MEMBERSHIP-IMPORT] Successfully created membership ...
   ```

6. **Verify in Database**
   ```sql
   -- Check clients created
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients
   WHERE org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4';

   -- Check membership plans created
   SELECT * FROM membership_plans
   WHERE organization_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;

   -- Check memberships assigned
   SELECT m.*, mp.name, c.email
   FROM memberships m
   JOIN membership_plans mp ON m.membership_plan_id = mp.id
   JOIN clients c ON m.customer_id = c.id
   WHERE m.organization_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4'
   ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;
   ```

### Automated E2E Testing

**File**: `/e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts`

```bash
# Run all import tests
npx playwright test e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts

# Run specific test
npx playwright test e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts -g "should import memberships"

# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts --ui

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts --debug
```

**Tests Included**:
1. ✅ Import clients CSV successfully
2. ✅ Import memberships CSV and create plans
3. ✅ Skip duplicate clients
4. ✅ Handle invalid CSV gracefully
5. ✅ Show background processing for large files
6. ✅ Display upload history

## Deployment Status

**Git Commit**: `Fix GoTeamUp membership import - critical schema bugs`
**Deployed**: October 6, 2025
**Environment**: Production (all 3 Vercel projects)

**Changes**:
- ✅ `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts` - Fixed schema bugs
- ✅ `/test-memberships.csv` - Added test data
- ✅ `/e2e/goteamup-import.spec.ts` - Added E2E tests
- ✅ This documentation file

## Known Limitations

1. **Custom Pricing Not Supported**: The `memberships` table doesn't have `custom_price` fields, so all clients get the plan's base price. If client-specific pricing is needed, a migration is required to add those columns.

2. **Billing Integration Not Included**: The `memberships` table doesn't have `payment_provider`, `payment_status`, or `billing_source` columns. Billing must be managed separately.

3. **Metadata Not Stored**: The `memberships` table doesn't have a `metadata` column, so import metadata (like original GoTeamUp price) is lost.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert the commit:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Old behavior:
- Memberships won't import (but won't error either)
- Clients may duplicate (because org_id check fails)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Custom Pricing Support**: Add migration to add `custom_price_pennies` column to `memberships` table
2. **Add Billing Integration**: Add `payment_provider` and `payment_status` columns
3. **Add Metadata Column**: Store import source and original data
4. **Bulk Operations**: Optimize imports using batch inserts instead of individual inserts
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Allow users to preview changes before importing
