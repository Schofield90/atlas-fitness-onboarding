### 3. Payment Security Implementation ‚úÖ

**Critical Security Fixes:**

1. **API Key Encryption** üîê
   - Created: `/lib/crypto/encryption.ts` - AES-256-GCM encryption utilities
   - Created: `/app/api/gym/stripe-connect/connect-existing-secure/route.ts` - Secure endpoint
   - Migration: `supabase/migrations/20251010_encrypt_api_keys.sql`

2. **Webhook Signature Verification** üîí
   - Created: `/lib/webhooks/signature-verification.ts`
   - Supports: Stripe, GoCardless, generic HMAC verification
   - Prevents: Webhook spoofing attacks

3. **Payment Amount Validation** üí∞
   - Server-side validation against membership plans
   - Security alert logging for mismatches
   - Protection against payment manipulation

4. **Security Testing Suite** üß™
   - Created: `tests/security/payment/payment-security.test.ts`
   - Automated tests for payment flows
   - Encryption/decryption validation

**Files Created:**

- `.env.security.example` - Environment variable template
- `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation guide (307 lines)
- `SECURITY_PAYMENT_REPORT.md` - Security audit report (290 lines)

**Commit:** `1fd56430` - "Add security implementation: API key encryption, webhook verification, payment validation"

### 4. Deployment & Branch Management ‚úÖ

**Branches Merged to Main:**

- `test/automations-system` - Workflow builder enhancements and RLS policies
- `security/input-validation-testing` - Payment security implementation

**Branches Cleaned Up:**

- Deleted: `security/input-validation-testing`
- Deleted: `security/payment-testing`

**Current Status:**

- Branch: `main`
- Status: Clean working tree
- Remote: Up to date with origin/main

## üö® Action Items Required

### Immediate - Security Activation

To activate the payment security features deployed today:

1. **Generate encryption key:**

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. **Add to Vercel environment variables** (all 3 projects):
   - `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (from step 1)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (get from Stripe dashboard)
   - `GOCARDLESS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (get from GoCardless dashboard)

3. **Apply database migration:**
   - Navigate to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy SQL from `supabase/migrations/20251010_encrypt_api_keys.sql`
   - Execute migration
   - Creates: `audit_logs`, `security_alerts`, encrypted columns

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Security features are deployed but inactive until environment variables are configured.

### Workflow Automation - User Testing

**Issue Reported:** Save button greyed out in workflow builder

**Debug Logging Added:**

- Console logs in `WorkflowBuilder.tsx` handleSave function
- User should refresh page, open DevTools, attempt save, share console output

**Next Steps:**

1. User tests workflow builder with debug logging
2. Collect console output
3. Fix specific issue preventing save button activation
4. Remove debug logging after fix

## üìä Background Tasks Running

### Malicious QA Tester Agent

**Status:** Running in background (launched ~15 minutes ago)

**Testing Scope:**

- XSS injection in workflow fields
- SQL injection attacks on API endpoints
- Authentication bypass attempts
- SSRF vulnerabilities in webhook URLs
- Business logic flaws

**Expected Output:**

- Comprehensive security report
- Vulnerability findings by severity
- Proof of concept for each issue
- Remediation recommendations
- Security score (0-100)

**Report Location:** Will be saved to markdown file when complete

## üîê Security Status

### RLS Policies - ‚úÖ SECURE

- Workflows: Protected by organization isolation
- Workflow Executions: Protected by organization isolation
- No cross-organization access possible
- Service role bypass: Intended (admin operations only)

### Payment Security - ‚è≥ PENDING ACTIVATION

- API key encryption: **Code deployed**, awaiting env vars
- Webhook verification: **Code deployed**, awaiting webhook secrets
- Payment validation: **Active and deployed**
- Security testing: **Test suite deployed**

### Overall Security Posture

- **RLS Coverage:** ‚úÖ Complete
- **Encryption:** ‚è≥ Pending activation
- **Audit Logging:** ‚è≥ Pending migration
- **Input Validation:** ‚úÖ Deployed (workflow system)
- **Payment Validation:** ‚úÖ Active

## üìù Documentation Created

1. `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete security implementation guide
2. `SECURITY_PAYMENT_REPORT.md` - Payment security audit findings
3. `.env.security.example` - Environment variable template
4. `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-10.md` - This summary document

---

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **RLS Policies Already Applied:** Migration file existed but policies were already in production
2. **Multi-Source Org Membership:** Access validated across 3 tables (user_organizations, organization_staff, organizations)
3. **Service Role Bypass:** Intentional design for admin operations - must validate auth before admin client usage
4. **Security Layering:** Multiple layers of protection (RLS, encryption, signature verification, validation)

---

## üîÑ Next Session Priorities

1. **Activate Payment Security:**
   - Configure environment variables
   - Apply database migration
   - Test encrypted API key storage
   - Verify webhook signature verification

2. **Workflow Save Button Fix:**
   - Review debug console output from user
   - Identify root cause of disabled state
   - Implement fix
   - Remove debug logging

3. **Security Testing Results:**
   - Review malicious-qa-tester report
   - Address any vulnerabilities found
   - Document remediation steps
