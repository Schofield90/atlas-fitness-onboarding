# Migration Strategy: Current Triggers to Enhanced Workflow System

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current trigger-based automation system to the enhanced node-based workflow system in Atlas Fitness CRM.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing System Components
1. **Database Tables**:
   - `workflows` (basic structure with JSONB nodes/edges)
   - `workflow_executions` (execution tracking)
   - Basic trigger system in `automations/scoring-triggers`

2. **Implementation Components**:
   - `WorkflowExecutor` class with basic node execution
   - Simple workflow builder components
   - Lead scoring automation triggers
   - Basic action types (email, SMS, WhatsApp, tags, tasks)

3. **Current Limitations**:
   - Limited trigger types (mainly lead scoring)
   - Basic conditional logic
   - No template system
   - Limited analytics and monitoring
   - No advanced scheduling
   - Basic webhook support

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Schema Migration
- **Action**: Apply enhanced database schema
- **File**: `/database_schema_enhanced_workflows.sql`
- **Impact**: Extends existing tables, adds new tables
- **Downtime**: Minimal (additive changes only)

```sql
-- Run migration
\i database_schema_enhanced_workflows.sql
```

#### 1.2 Data Migration
- **Action**: Migrate existing workflow data to new structure
- **Scripts**: Create migration scripts for:
  - Converting existing workflows to new format
  - Preserving execution history
  - Migrating trigger configurations

```typescript
// Migration script example
async function migrateExistingWorkflows() {
  const existingWorkflows = await supabase
    .from('workflows')
    .select('*')
    .not('nodes', 'is', null);

  for (const workflow of existingWorkflows) {
    // Convert old node format to new enhanced format
    const enhancedNodes = workflow.nodes.map(node => ({
      ...node,
      data: {
        ...node.data,
        version: '2.0',
        enhanced: true
      }
    }));

    // Create workflow triggers from trigger_config
    if (workflow.trigger_config) {
      await supabase.from('workflow_triggers').insert({
        workflow_id: workflow.id,
        organization_id: workflow.organization_id,
        trigger_type: workflow.trigger_type,
        trigger_config: workflow.trigger_config
      });
    }

    // Update workflow with enhanced structure
    await supabase
      .from('workflows')
      .update({
        nodes: enhancedNodes,
        version: 2
      })

## Migration Execution Plan

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Test migration scripts on staging environment
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Notify users of maintenance window
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are configured

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Backup current database
pg_dump atlas_fitness > backup_pre_migration.sql

# 2. Apply schema enhancements
psql -d atlas_fitness -f database_schema_enhanced_workflows.sql

# 3. Run data migration scripts
node migration_scripts/migrate_workflows.js
node migration_scripts/migrate_triggers.js
node migration_scripts/validate_migration.js
```

#### Step 2: Code Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy enhanced execution engine
git deploy enhanced-workflow-engine

# 2. Update API endpoints
git deploy enhanced-workflow-api

# 3. Deploy enhanced UI components
git deploy enhanced-workflow-builder
```

#### Step 3: System Validation
```bash
# 1. Run integration tests
npm run test:integration:workflows

# 2. Validate existing workflows still work
node scripts/validate_existing_workflows.js

# 3. Test new features
npm run test:e2e:workflows
```

### Post-Migration Tasks

#### Data Validation
- Verify all existing workflows migrated correctly
- Confirm execution history is preserved
- Test trigger functionality
- Validate user permissions

#### Performance Testing
- Load test enhanced execution engine
- Monitor database performance
- Verify analytics data collection
- Test webhook processing

#### User Training
- Create migration guide for users
- Document new features
- Provide training sessions
- Update help documentation

## Compatibility and Fallback

### Backward Compatibility
- Old workflow format remains supported during transition
- Existing API endpoints continue to work
- Gradual migration allows testing at each step
- Rollback capability at each phase

### Fallback Strategy
```typescript
// Example fallback mechanism
class WorkflowExecutor {
  async execute(workflow: Workflow) {
    // Try enhanced execution first
    try {
      if (workflow.version >= 2) {
        return await this.executeEnhanced(workflow);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Enhanced execution failed, falling back to legacy');
    }
    
    // Fall back to legacy execution
    return await this.executeLegacy(workflow);
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: Large JSONB transformations
2. **Execution Engine**: Complex node processing logic
3. **User Experience**: Workflow builder changes
4. **Performance**: New analytics collection overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to subset of organizations first
2. **Feature Flags**: Toggle new features on/off
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and alerting
4. **Rollback Plan**: Quick rollback to previous version
