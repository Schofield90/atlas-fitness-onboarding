# Signup Flow Fix - Quick Summary

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Date:** 2025-09-04
**Environment:** Production (lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn.supabase.co)

---

## What Was Broken

New user signups were failing with:

```
new row violates row-level security policy for table 'users'
```

---

## Root Causes

1. **Schema Mismatch:** Trigger was trying to insert `settings` column that doesn't exist in `users` table
2. **RLS Blocking:** Trigger didn't have JWT context to bypass RLS policies

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Non-Existent Column

```sql
-- BEFORE (broken)
INSERT INTO public.users (
  id, organization_id, email, name, role, avatar_url,
  settings,  -- ‚ùå Column doesn't exist
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- AFTER (fixed)
INSERT INTO public.users (
  id, organization_id, email, name, role, avatar_url,
  created_at, updated_at  -- ‚úÖ No settings column
)
```

### 2. Added RLS Bypass

```sql
-- Added at start of trigger function
PERFORM set_config('request.jwt.claims', '{"role":"service_role"}', true);
```

This allows the `SECURITY DEFINER` function to bypass RLS policies by appearing as `service_role`.

---

## Verification

All tests pass:

- ‚úÖ Trigger fires on new auth user creation
- ‚úÖ Organization created with unique slug
- ‚úÖ User record created successfully
- ‚úÖ user_organizations link created
- ‚úÖ RLS policies allow proper access

**Test Output:**

```
‚úÖ Organization created: 78450a03-57a5-4db0-823d-01c9895dd02e
‚úÖ User record created
‚úÖ user_organizations link created
üéâ SUCCESS: All signup flow components working perfectly!
‚úÖ Ready for production signups
```
