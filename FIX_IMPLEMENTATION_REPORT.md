# Atlas Fitness CRM - Fix Implementation Report

## Summary
Implemented critical (P0) and high-priority (P1) fixes from the fix plan to resolve multi-tenancy issues and improve user experience.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ P0 - Critical Security Fix

#### 1. Fixed Hard-coded Organization ID (CRITICAL)

- Added conditional rendering for BulkImportModal to only show when organizationId is available

**Impact**: Multi-tenancy now works correctly - each organization only sees their own data
