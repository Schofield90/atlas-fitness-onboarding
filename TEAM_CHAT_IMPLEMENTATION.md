2. **Files not uploading**
   - Check file size (max 10MB)
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Check Supabase Storage configuration

3. **Notifications not working**
   - Grant browser notification permissions
   - Check notification settings in user preferences
   - Verify notifications are enabled for the channel

4. **Real-time updates slow**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Monitor Supabase Realtime connection status
   - Consider refreshing the page to reconnect

## Migration Guide

The system includes a comprehensive migration that:
1. Creates all required tables with proper relationships
2. Sets up Row Level Security policies
3. Creates indexes for optimal performance
4. Includes database functions and triggers
5. Enables Supabase Realtime on all tables

To apply the migration:
```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase migration up

# Or apply manually through Supabase dashboard
# Copy contents of 20250906_team_chat_system.sql
# Run in SQL editor
```

The migration is designed to be non-destructive and can be safely applied to existing databases.

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the team chat system:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review browser console for error messages
3. Verify database migration was applied correctly
4. Check Supabase dashboard for any policy or permission issues

The system is designed to be self-contained and should work out of the box once the migration is applied and the components are properly integrated into your application layout.
