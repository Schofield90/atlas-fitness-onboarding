# GoTeamUp Migration Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration Status Page UI Improvements

✅ **Added date/time display for all migration jobs**

- Shows created date and time for each job
- Shows started time when available
- Added timestamps to job details section

✅ **Added delete functionality for failed/cancelled jobs**

- Delete button appears for failed and cancelled jobs
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Clears selected job if it gets deleted
- Button in both job list and job details

### 2. Database Fix Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: You need to run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard**

```sql
-- Add missing columns to migration tables
-- This fixes the 500 error on /api/migration/jobs/[id]/conflicts

-- Add source_row_number column to migration_records table if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE public.migration_records
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS source_row_number INTEGER;

-- Add index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_migration_records_source_row
ON public.migration_records(migration_job_id, source_row_number);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.migration_records.source_row_number IS 'Row number from the source CSV file for tracking';
```

**Run it here:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn/sql/new

## Status

### ✅ Already Deployed

- Migration status page with date/time display
- Delete functionality for failed jobs
- All authentication fixes (using user_organizations table)
- Migration service code that uses source_row_number

### ⚠️ Pending Action

- Run the SQL migration above in Supabase Dashboard

## How to Test

1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Migrations
3. Upload a GoTeamUp CSV file
4. The migration should now work without 500 errors
5. Failed jobs can be deleted from the status page

## Root Cause

The migration service was trying to query a `source_row_number` column that didn't exist in the database. This column is used to track which row in the CSV file each record came from, helping with conflict resolution and debugging.

## Next Steps

After running the SQL:

1. Test a new GoTeamUp migration
2. Check that conflicts load properly
3. Verify delete functionality works for failed jobs
