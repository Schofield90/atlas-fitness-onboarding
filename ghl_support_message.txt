Subject: API Access for Call Recordings - Private Integration Setup

Dear GoHighLevel Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out for assistance with accessing call recordings through the GoHighLevel API for my business automation needs.

**Current Situation:**
I'm trying to programmatically access and download call recordings from my GoHighLevel account to integrate with my business intelligence system. I need to process approximately 800 call recordings for sales training and analysis purposes.

**What I've Tried:**
- Set up a Private Integration in my GHL account
- Generated API token: pit-7ac049a7-6478-411c-9bda-fb5c28f1e2f3
- Location ID: KcbX6Rp7obaoXXEzVc7w
- Tested multiple API endpoints including:
  - https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/locations/{locationId}/calls
  - https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/locations/{locationId}/calls
  - Various other endpoint combinations

**Issues Encountered:**
- Consistently receiving 404 "Not Found" errors on call-related endpoints
- Some endpoints return 401 "Unauthorized" despite using valid API tokens
- Unable to locate current API documentation for call recording access

**What I Need:**
1. Correct API base URL and endpoint structure for accessing call recordings
2. Proper authentication method for private integrations
3. Required permissions or additional setup steps for call recording API access
4. Current API documentation specific to call recordings functionality

**My Setup:**
- Private Integration configured in GHL
- API token with appropriate permissions (I believe)
- Looking to filter calls with hasRecording=true parameter
- Need to download recording files programmatically

**Use Case:**
This is for legitimate business purposes - analyzing sales call patterns, training team members, and improving our sales processes. All data will be handled securely and in compliance with privacy requirements.

Could you please provide:
- The correct API endpoint structure for call recordings
- Any additional setup required for private integrations to access call data
- Updated API documentation or developer resources

I'd greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide. If there's a specific department or developer support channel better suited for API-related questions, please let me know.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
