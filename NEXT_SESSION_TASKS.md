### 3. Automation Builder Enhancement

- **Visual Status**: Clear indication of AI state in automation interface

## 🔥 CRITICAL NEXT TASKS (Do These First!)

### 1. Database Migration (HIGH PRIORITY - 5 minutes)
```sql
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query
-- Copy/paste content from: /supabase/ai-chatbot-toggle.sql
-- Click "Run" to create all AI toggle tables and functions
```

### 2. Navigation Link Addition (2 minutes)
```tsx
// File: /app/components/DashboardLayout.tsx
// Add to settings menu:
{
  name: 'AI Chatbot',
  href: '/settings/ai-chatbot',
  icon: Bot
}
```

### 3. Test AI Toggle End-to-End (10 minutes)
1. **Global Toggle**: Go to `/settings/ai-chatbot` → Toggle AI off → Send WhatsApp message → Should get fallback
2. **Keyword Handoff**: Send "human" via WhatsApp → Should auto-handoff → Check activity logs
3. **Manual Handoff**: Use conversation toggle → Verify fallback message sent
4. **Resume AI**: Toggle AI back on → Verify normal AI responses resume

### 4. TypeScript Fixes (15 minutes)
Fix the remaining TypeScript errors that prevented clean commit:
- Fix Supabase client async calls in API routes
- Update lucide-react imports (EmailIcon → MailIcon)
- Fix type mismatches in automation components

## 💡 IMMEDIATE TESTING GUIDE

### Test Scenario 1: Global AI Control
```bash
1. Go to: https://your-domain.com/settings/ai-chatbot
2. Toggle "Global AI Chat" to OFF
3. Send WhatsApp message: "Hello, what are your hours?"
4. Expected: Should receive fallback message, not AI response
5. Check Activity Logs tab → Should see "AI disabled" log entry
```

### Test Scenario 2: Keyword Auto-Handoff
```bash
1. Ensure Global AI is ON
2. Send WhatsApp: "I want to speak to a human"
3. Expected: AI should respond "I'll connect you with team member..."
4. Send another message: Should get fallback, not AI response
5. Check Activity Logs → Should see "Auto-handoff keyword detected"
```

### Test Scenario 3: Manual Conversation Handoff
```bash
1. Go to: /settings/ai-chatbot → "Active Conversations" tab
2. Find a conversation → Click "Hand Off" button
3. Add reason: "Complex pricing question"
4. Send WhatsApp from that number → Should get fallback message
5. Use "Resume AI" button → Next message should get AI response
```
