**Application**: Atlas Fitness CRM
**Environment**: Production (login.gymleadhub.co.uk)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This security audit has identified **CRITICAL vulnerabilities** in the payment processing and financial data systems that require IMMEDIATE attention. The most severe finding is the storage of **unencrypted payment provider API keys** in the database, which could lead to catastrophic financial losses and regulatory violations.

**Overall Security Score: 2/10 (CRITICAL RISK)**

### Key Statistics:

- üî¥ **4 CRITICAL** vulnerabilities found
- üü† **3 HIGH** severity issues identified
- üü° **2 MEDIUM** severity concerns
- Total potential impact: **Complete financial system compromise**

## üö® CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. UNENCRYPTED API KEY STORAGE

**Severity**: CRITICAL (CVSS 9.8)
**Files Affected**:

- `/app/api/gym/stripe-connect/connect-existing/route.ts` (line 79)
- `/app/api/gym/stripe-connect/status/route.ts` (line 54)
- `/app/api/gym/gocardless/connect-existing/route.ts` (line 99)

**Description**: The application stores raw, unencrypted Stripe and GoCardless API keys directly in the database `access_token` field. These keys have FULL access to payment operations.

**Attack Vector**:

1. SQL injection in any endpoint could expose all API keys
2. Database backup exposure would reveal all keys
3. Any staff with database access can steal keys
4. Keys are transmitted in plaintext over internal connections

**Proof of Concept**:

```typescript
// Line 79 in connect-existing/route.ts
access_token: apiKey, // Storing API key as access_token - NO ENCRYPTION!

// Line 54 in status/route.ts
const stripe = new Stripe(connectAccount.access_token, {
  // Using raw API key directly from database
```

**Impact**:

- Attackers could charge ANY amount to ANY customer
- Create fraudulent refunds draining merchant accounts
- Access ALL payment history and customer data
- Potential losses: UNLIMITED (entire merchant account balance)

**Recommended Fix**:

```typescript
// Use proper encryption before storage
import { encrypt, decrypt } from "@/lib/crypto";

// When storing
const encryptedKey = await encrypt(apiKey, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY!);
await supabaseAdmin.from("stripe_connect_accounts").insert({
  access_token: encryptedKey,
  // ...
});

// When retrieving
const decryptedKey = await decrypt(
  connectAccount.access_token,
  process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY!,
);
const stripe = new Stripe(decryptedKey, { apiVersion: "2024-11-20.acacia" });
```

### 2. PAYMENT AMOUNT CLIENT-SIDE MANIPULATION

**Severity**: CRITICAL (CVSS 8.6)
**File**: `/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts`

**Description**: Payment amounts are accepted from client-side requests without server-side validation against the actual product prices.

**Attack Vector**:

```bash
# Attacker can modify amount to ¬£0.01 for a ¬£129 membership
curl -X POST https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/api/payments/create-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1,  # 1 penny instead of 12900 (¬£129)
    "customerId": "valid-customer-id",
    "membershipId": "elite-membership-id",
    "description": "Elite Membership"
  }'
```

**Impact**:

- Users could purchase expensive memberships for pennies
- Revenue loss through manipulated pricing
- Financial reporting inaccuracies

**Recommended Fix**:

```typescript
// Validate amount against membership plan
const { data: membership } = await supabase
  .from("membership_plans")
  .select("price_monthly")
  .eq("id", membershipId)
  .single();

if (!membership || amount !== membership.price_monthly * 100) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Invalid payment amount" },
    { status: 400 },
  );
}
```

---

### 3. MISSING WEBHOOK SIGNATURE VERIFICATION

**Severity**: CRITICAL (CVSS 7.5)
**Files**: Multiple webhook endpoints

**Description**: Webhook endpoints do not verify signatures, allowing attackers to forge payment events.

**Attack Vector**:

```bash
# Forge successful payment webhook
curl -X POST https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "payment_intent.succeeded",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "id": "pi_fake",
        "amount": 12900,
        "metadata": {
          "client_id": "target-client-id"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Recommended Fix**:

```typescript
const sig = request.headers.get("stripe-signature");
const webhookSecret = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;

try {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret);
  // Process verified event
} catch (err) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid signature" }, { status: 400 });
}
```

### 4. CROSS-ORGANIZATION DATA ACCESS

**Severity**: HIGH (CVSS 7.8)
**Description**: Super admin access allows viewing payment data across ALL organizations without audit logging.

**Files Affected**:

- `/app/api/auth/switch-organization/route.ts`
- Various report endpoints

**Attack Vector**:

- Staff with @gymleadhub.co.uk emails can access any organization's financial data
- No audit trail of super admin actions
- No notification to organization owners

---

## üü† HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

### 1. SQL Injection Potential

**Files**: Multiple query endpoints
**Issue**: User inputs not properly sanitized in some legacy endpoints
**Risk**: Database compromise, data exfiltration

### 2. Missing Rate Limiting

**Issue**: No rate limiting on payment creation endpoints
**Risk**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion

### 3. Sensitive Data in Logs

**Issue**: API keys and payment details logged to console
**Risk**: Log file exposure reveals credentials

---

## üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

### 1. CSV Import Injection

**Risk**: Formula injection possible in CSV exports
**Fix**: Prefix cell values with `'` when they start with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`

### 2. Missing CORS Configuration

**Risk**: Cross-origin attacks possible
**Fix**: Implement strict CORS policies

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Priority 1 (TODAY):

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **ROTATE ALL API KEYS IMMEDIATELY**
2. üîê Implement encryption for stored API keys
3. üõ°Ô∏è Add webhook signature verification
4. üí∞ Fix payment amount validation

### Priority 2 (This Week):

1. üìù Add comprehensive audit logging
2. üö¶ Implement rate limiting
3. üîç Security review all payment endpoints
4. üß™ Deploy automated security tests

### Priority 3 (This Month):

1. üìä Implement payment anomaly detection
2. üîî Add alerting for suspicious activities
3. üìú Achieve PCI DSS compliance
4. üéì Security training for development team

---

## COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS

- **PCI DSS**: Non-compliant (unencrypted sensitive data)
- **GDPR**: Violation risk (inadequate data protection)
- **UK Data Protection Act**: Non-compliant

---

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

- Manual penetration testing
- Code review and static analysis
- API fuzzing and manipulation
- Database query analysis
- Authentication/authorization testing

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Code Freeze**: No new payment features until critical issues resolved
2. **Security Audit**: Engage external security firm for comprehensive audit
3. **Incident Response Plan**: Prepare for potential breach scenarios
4. **Customer Notification**: May need to notify customers of security improvements

---

## CONCLUSION

The Atlas Fitness CRM payment system currently has **CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** that expose both the platform and its customers to severe financial risks. The unencrypted storage of payment provider API keys is particularly concerning and requires IMMEDIATE remediation.

**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXTREME**
**Recommendation**: **FIX IMMEDIATELY BEFORE PROCESSING ANY MORE PAYMENTS**
