## Overall Assessment

The platform is **mostly functional** with good core features working. Main issues are:

- Public booking access (critical for customer acquisition)
- Some workflow builder features need fixes
- Various console errors need cleanup
- Performance optimization needed for booking page

The platform successfully handles:

- Multi-tenant authentication
- CRM/customer management
- Basic workflow automation
- Form management
- Integration setup

**Recommendation**: Fix critical issues first (public booking, workflow testing) then address console errors and performance.
