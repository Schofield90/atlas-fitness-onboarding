# Atlas Fitness Platform - Fixes Summary

**Date**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Completed and Deployed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Profile Update 500 Error (Members Portal)

**Problem**: Members received a 500 error when updating their profile at https://members.gymleadhub.co.uk/client/profile

**Root Cause**:

- Database column name inconsistency (`org_id` vs `organization_id`)
- Poor error handling that returned generic "Internal Server Error"

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Added support for both `org_id` and `organization_id` columns
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with detailed context
- ✅ Implemented specific error messages based on error type
- ✅ Replaced browser alerts with toast notifications for better UX

**Files Modified**:

- `/app/api/client/profile/update/route.ts`
- `/app/client/profile/page.tsx`

### 2. Membership Loading Issue

**Problem**: Memberships were not loading when trying to add them to members

**Root Cause**:

- Organization ID lookup only checked `user_organizations` table
- Missing fallback to `organization_staff` table

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Added fallback logic to check both organization tables
- ✅ Fixed queries to handle both column name variations
- ✅ Added comprehensive error messages for debugging
- ✅ Fixed order by clause (price_pennies instead of price)

**Files Modified**:

- `/app/components/customers/AddMembershipModal.tsx`

### 3. Localhost Authentication Issue

**Problem**: Login sessions don't persist on localhost development

**Status**: ⚠️ Identified but requires further investigation

- Production works correctly
- Issue is specific to localhost development environment
- Related to middleware cookie handling bypass

**Temporary Fix**:

- Commented out localhost bypass in middleware.ts (lines 247-250)
- Needs proper development environment solution

## Production Deployment

✅ **Successfully deployed to production**

- Deployment URL: https://atlas-fitness-onboarding-iitedbf5m-schofield90s-projects.vercel.app
- Build completed with warnings (non-critical)
- All subdomains operational (members, login, admin)

## Test Results

### Production Health Check

- ✅ members.gymleadhub.co.uk - Accessible
- ✅ login.gymleadhub.co.uk - Accessible
- ✅ admin.gymleadhub.co.uk - Accessible

### API Endpoints

- ✅ `/api/client/profile/update` - Returns proper auth errors
- ✅ `/api/client/profile` - Secured with authentication
- ✅ Error messages are now specific and helpful

## Recommendations

1. **Database Schema Standardization**:
   - Standardize on `organization_id` across all tables
   - Create migration to rename `org_id` columns

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Implement proper cookie handling for localhost
   - Consider using environment-specific middleware configuration

3. **Testing**:
   - Add E2E tests for profile update flow
   - Add integration tests for membership management
   - Set up automated testing pipeline

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Add error tracking for profile update failures
   - Monitor membership loading performance
   - Track authentication success rates

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create database migration to standardize column names
- [ ] Implement proper localhost authentication solution
- [ ] Add comprehensive E2E test suite
- [ ] Set up error monitoring and alerting
