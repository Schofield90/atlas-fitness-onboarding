# Gym Dashboard
vercel --yes -A vercel.gym.json --prod

# Member Portal
vercel --yes -A vercel.member.json --prod
```

## üîê Next Steps

### 1. Add Environment Variables

Go to each Vercel project dashboard and add the required environment variables:

**All Projects Need:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imx6bHJvam9heHJxdm1oZW1wbmtuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MjQ1MTA2NTUsImV4cCI6MjA0MDA4NjY1NX0.6taEJs76bZBbeuQBc5qZ0m-pS5ZxUX91RsPh-qvvGK4
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your service role key]
```

**Gym Dashboard Also Needs:**

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://helping-pegasus-10661.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=ASmlAAIncDI1OTBiNjA3NDM2NmY0YmIzYmFlYjEwMjVmOTc5M2YwMnAyMTA2NjE
OPENAI_API_KEY=[if you have one]
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=[if you have one]
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=[if you have one]
```

### 2. Configure Custom Domains

In each Vercel project, add your custom domains:

- Atlas Admin ‚Üí admin.gymleadhub.co.uk
- Atlas Gym Dashboard ‚Üí login.gymleadhub.co.uk
- Atlas Member Portal ‚Üí members.gymleadhub.co.uk

### 3. Update DNS Records

Add CNAME records pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com` for each subdomain.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Setup

1. **Independent Scaling**: Each app can scale independently based on its traffic
2. **Isolated Deployments**: Updates to one app don't affect the others
3. **Separate Build Pipelines**: Faster deployments as only the changed app rebuilds
4. **Better Resource Allocation**: Each project gets its own build resources
5. **Easier Debugging**: Issues are isolated to specific projects
6. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different projects
7. **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for what each app uses

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits for 100+ Gyms

This multi-project setup is ideal for scaling to 100+ gyms because:

- **Admin Portal** handles super admin operations with minimal traffic
- **Gym Dashboard** scales with the number of gym owners/staff
- **Member Portal** scales independently for thousands of gym members
- Each tier has its own caching strategy and performance optimizations
- Database connections are pooled per project, avoiding connection limits
- Redis caching on Gym Dashboard reduces database load for frequently accessed data

## üìä Monitoring

Each project now has independent:

- Analytics dashboards
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Deployment history
- Environment variable management

You can monitor each project separately in the Vercel dashboard, making it easier to identify and fix issues specific to each user tier.
