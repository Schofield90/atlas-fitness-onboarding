## ðŸ¤– Cursor AI Integration

This project includes Cursor AI agents for automated code review, debugging, and security analysis.

### Installing Cursor CLI

```bash
# Install Cursor CLI
curl -fsSL https://cursor.com/install | bash

# Verify installation
cursor --version
```

### Available AI Commands

The repository includes custom AI agents in `.cursor/commands/`:

- **Bug Hunt** - Quick scan for critical bugs
- **Code Review** - Comprehensive PR review
- **Security Review** - Security and compliance audit

### Using Cursor Agents

#### In the Cursor IDE

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` and select:

- "Cursor: Bug Hunt"
- "Cursor: Code Review"
- "Cursor: Security Review"

Or use slash commands in chat:

```
/bug-hunt
/code-review
/security-review
```

#### From Terminal (CLI)

```bash
# Run bug hunt on current changes
cursor-agent bug-hunt

# Review specific file
cursor-agent code-review --file app/api/route.ts

# Security audit for PR
cursor-agent security-review --pr 123
```

### AI Rules and Guidelines

Our AI agents follow strict rules defined in `.cursor/rules.md`:

- Engineering guardrails (security, multi-tenancy, testing)
- Communication style (direct, no fluff)
- Automatic fixes for common issues

### CI Integration

The CI pipeline automatically:

- Runs TypeScript checks
- Executes linting
- Runs unit and E2E tests
- Can attempt auto-fixes (when configured with CURSOR_API_KEY)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed development workflow.

## Integrations

### Meta Lead Ads Webhook Setup

#### Configuration

- **Callback URL**: `https://atlas-fitness-onboarding.vercel.app/api/webhooks/facebook-leads`
- **Verify Token**: Set `FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` or `META_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` in env vars
- **App Secret**: Set `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` or `META_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for signature verification
- **Webhook Subscriptions**: Subscribe to Page â†’ `leadgen` field in Meta App Dashboard

#### Testing & Monitoring

- **Dashboard Test**: App Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Page â†’ Test â†’ Create Lead
- **Logs**: Vercel â†’ Deployments â†’ Functions â†’ Look for `[fb_leadgen_webhook]` entries
- **Health Check**: `GET /api/webhooks/health` - Shows webhook status, recent events, and page subscriptions
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If test shows "Pending", check Vercel Functions logs for POST requests
  - Verify webhook URL is exactly as configured (no trailing slash)
  - Ensure middleware isn't blocking `/api/webhooks` paths
  - Check signature verification isn't failing silently

#### Field Mapping

- Form questions auto-refresh when accessing field mappings
- Manual refresh: `POST /api/integrations/facebook/refresh-form-questions`
- Mappings saved per form in `facebook_field_mappings` table

#### Permissions Required

- `leads_retrieval` - Fetch lead details after webhook notification
- `pages_manage_metadata` - Subscribe pages to webhooks
- `pages_show_list` - List available pages

## E2E Authentication

Our E2E tests support automatic authentication for different user roles across multiple subdomains.

### Setup

1. Copy the test environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   ```

2. Update `.env.test` with your Supabase credentials

3. Set up authentication states:
   ```bash
   npm run e2e:prepare-auth
   ```

### Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests with auth
npm run e2e

# Run tests for specific portals
npm run e2e:admin   # Admin portal tests
npm run e2e:owner   # Owner/Coach portal tests
npm run e2e:member  # Member portal tests

# Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Writing Authenticated Tests

Tests automatically use the correct authentication based on the project:

```typescript
// This test runs as an authenticated owner
test.describe("Owner Features", () => {
  test.use({ project: "owner" });

  test("can access protected route", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/dashboard");
    // Already authenticated - no login needed
  });
});
```

### Supported Portals

- **admin.localhost:3000** - Super admin role
- **login.localhost:3000** - Owner/Coach roles
- **members.localhost:3000** - Member role

### Security

The test login route (`/api/test/login`) is ONLY available when:

- `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` OR
- `ALLOW_TEST_LOGIN=true` is explicitly set

Never deploy with `ALLOW_TEST_LOGIN=true` in production.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Cookie issues**: Ensure `.localhost` domain is used for local development
2. **Auth state not persisting**: Check that cookies are set with correct domain
3. **Service role key**: Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in environment
