# Session Notes - September 22, 2025

## Work Completed Today

### 1. AI Nutrition Coach Improvements

- **Fixed Repetitive Responses**: Removed the repetitive "Thank you for sharing that with me. I can see how that impacts your daily nutrition..." message that appeared after every question
  - File: `/app/components/nutrition/AdvancedCoach.tsx` (lines 405, 429)

- **Added Progress Persistence**: Implemented localStorage to save conversation progress across page reloads
  - Saves messages, user context, question index, and current phase
  - Added reset button (ðŸ”„) to start fresh when needed
  - File: `/app/components/nutrition/AdvancedCoach.tsx`

### 2. Navigation Restructuring

- **Moved Nutrition Coach from CRM to Booking Tab**
  - Removed from CRM navigation (was at line 374-392)
  - Added to Booking navigation after "Staff Management" (line 757-775)
  - File: `/app/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`

### 3. Fixed Navigation Issues

- **Fixed Missing Sidebar on Nutrition Coach Page**
  - Wrapped all content with `DashboardLayout` component
  - File: `/app/coach/nutrition/page.tsx`

### 4. Authentication Fixes

- **Fixed Gym Member Login Redirect Issue**
  - Changed password auth to redirect to `/client/dashboard` instead of `/dashboard`
  - Now properly creates Supabase session in development
  - File: `/app/api/auth/password/route.ts` (lines 101-152)

### 5. Security Assessment

Conducted comprehensive 4-agent security testing that discovered:

#### Critical Vulnerabilities Found:

1. **Exposed Source Code & Credentials**
   - .git directory publicly accessible
   - .env files with database passwords exposed
   - 16 source code files downloadable

2. **Unauthenticated Admin Access**
   - 6 admin endpoints accessible without login
   - `/admin-direct`, `/saas-admin`, `/admin-debug` completely open

3. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Authentication endpoints vulnerable to brute force
   - Unlimited login attempts allowed

4. **XSS Vulnerabilities**
   - 14 HIGH severity XSS injection points
   - Reflected XSS via redirect parameters
   - No input sanitization on forms

5. **IDOR & Multi-tenant Isolation**
   - Can access other organizations' data
   - `/settings?org_id=X` allows cross-tenant access

#### Security Test Files Created:

- `/SECURITY-BREACH-REPORT.md`
- `/PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_VULNERABILITY_REPORT.md`
- `/xss-vulnerability-report.json`
- Multiple test scripts for future security regression testing

## Files Modified Today

### Core Application Files:

1. `/app/components/nutrition/AdvancedCoach.tsx` - Fixed repetitive responses, added persistence
2. `/app/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Moved Nutrition Coach to Booking tab
3. `/app/coach/nutrition/page.tsx` - Added DashboardLayout wrapper
4. `/app/api/auth/password/route.ts` - Fixed member login redirect

### Test Files Created:

1. `/test-login.js` - Password login testing
2. `/test-login-detailed.js` - Detailed login flow testing
3. `/dashboard-test.png` - Dashboard screenshot
4. Multiple security test scripts (see Security Assessment section)

## Environment Setup

### Current Running Processes:

- Development server on port 3001: `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" PORT=3001 npm run dev`
- Multiple background processes for testing

### Known Credentials (for testing only):

- Test account: samschofield90@hotmail.co.uk / @Aa80236661

## Pending Security Fixes Required

### CRITICAL (Within 24 Hours):

1. Block .git and .env access in web server config
2. Rotate ALL credentials (database, API keys)
3. Add authentication middleware to admin routes
4. Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints

### HIGH (Within 48 Hours):

1. Add Content Security Policy headers
2. Implement input sanitization with DOMPurify
3. Fix IDOR vulnerabilities with ownership checks
4. Remove debug endpoints from production

### MEDIUM (Within 1 Week):

1. Conduct full security audit of all endpoints
2. Implement proper RBAC system
3. Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
4. Set up security monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps

1. Address critical security vulnerabilities before production deployment
2. Complete testing of nutrition coach features
3. Implement remaining security recommendations
4. Consider adding automated security testing to CI/CD pipeline

## Notes for Continuing Work

- All security test scripts are in project root for regression testing
- Nutrition coach now saves progress but may need UX improvements
- Login system works but needs proper session management in development
- Consider implementing proper development authentication bypass instead of magic links
