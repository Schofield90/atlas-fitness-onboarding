## Recent Deployments

### October 17, 2025 - ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX (v2): GoHighLevel Calendar Availability - ALL Time Slots Bug

- **ISSUE**: Production showing ALL possible time slots (08:30, 08:45, 09:00...) instead of only available slots
- **USER TESTING**: Local shows 6 morning + 8 afternoon slots (correct), Production shows every 15-min slot (wrong)
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
  - Previous fix (October 17 AM) was incomplete and never actually deployed
  - `gohighlevel-tools.ts` was NOT actually copied to gym-dashboard
  - gym-dashboard registry was NOT updated to import GOHIGHLEVEL_TOOLS
  - Only admin-portal had the correct setup
- **ACTUAL FIX APPLIED (October 17 PM)**:
  - âœ… Copied `gohighlevel-tools.ts` from `/app/lib/ai-agents/tools/` â†’ `/apps/gym-dashboard/app/lib/ai-agents/tools/`
  - âœ… Added `import { GOHIGHLEVEL_TOOLS } from "./gohighlevel-tools";` to gym-dashboard registry (line 19)
  - âœ… Added `...GOHIGHLEVEL_TOOLS,` to allTools array in registry (line 42)
- **FILES CHANGED**:
  - `/apps/gym-dashboard/app/lib/ai-agents/tools/gohighlevel-tools.ts` (NEW - copied from root)
  - `/apps/gym-dashboard/app/lib/ai-agents/tools/registry.ts` (lines 19, 42)
- **WHY LOCAL WORKED**: Local uses root `/app/lib/` which had the tools, production uses `/apps/gym-dashboard/app/lib/`
- **EXPECTED RESULT**: Production now filters slots via GHL `/free-slots` API, showing only genuinely available times
- **TEST URL**: https://admin.gymleadhub.co.uk/saas-admin/lead-bots/test/[agentId] â†’ Check Booking Times
- **MONOREPO NOTE**: Production builds require files in EACH app's `/app/lib/` directory, not just root

  - `/saas-admin/lead-bots/guardrails` - Natural language guardrails management
  - `/saas-admin/lead-bots/reports` - Performance reports

- **FILES CHANGED**:
  - `/apps/gym-dashboard/app/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (lines 539-557)
- **STATUS**: Now deployed and accessible from sidebar
- **USER REQUEST**: "where is the ai testing bit we made before, I cant see it in the side menu"

### October 12, 2025 22:30 - âœ… VERIFIED FIX: AI Landing Page Generation (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configured correctly

  - Added comprehensive E2E test suite

### October 12, 2025 15:05 - CRITICAL FIX: Conversations API 500 Error

- PostgreSQL error code 42703 was causing 500 Internal Server Error
- Query now works: returns 32 conversations successfully
- This fixes: chat history not loading, second messages disappearing
