## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Public Booking Pages (CRITICAL)**
   - Investigate why `/book/public` routes return 404
   - Check if route exists in app directory
   - Verify middleware is actually deployed

2. **Fix Staff Management API**
   - Check if database column actually exists as `organization_id`
   - Verify the API fix was deployed correctly
   - May need direct database inspection

3. **Investigate Console Errors**
   - Track down source of 400/406 errors
   - Fix undefined property errors
   - Clean up API response handling

### Testing Coverage

| Module | Tested | Working | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | Login works correctly |
| Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | Loads, upgrade button fixed |
| Contacts | ✅ | ✅ | List loads, add customer works |
| Staff Management | ✅ | ❌ | API errors persist |
| Workflows | ✅ | ⚠️ | Loads but needs manual D&D test |
| Public Booking | ✅ | ❌ | 404 error - critical issue |
| Billing | ✅ | ✅ | Page loads when clicked |
| Facebook Integration | ✅ | ⚠️ | Shows connected but has errors |

## Summary

**Fixes Successfully Deployed**: 5/8 (62.5%)
**Critical Issues Remaining**: 2 (Public booking, Staff API)
**Overall Platform Status**: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

The deployment was successful and several fixes are working in production. However, two critical issues remain that block key functionality:
1. Customers cannot access public booking pages
2. Staff management is completely broken

These should be addressed immediately as they impact core business operations.
