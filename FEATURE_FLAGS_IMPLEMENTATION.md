# Feature Flags Implementation Report

## Summary
Implemented a feature flag system to gate incomplete features in the Atlas Fitness CRM, preventing users from accessing non-functional buttons and mock data sections.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feature Flags Configuration (`/app/lib/feature-flags.ts`)
- Created centralized feature flag configuration
- Flags for campaigns and surveys modules
- Environment variable overrides support
- Export functions: `isFeatureEnabled()`, `getFeatureFlags()`, `useFeatureFlag()`

### 2. ComingSoon Component (`/app/components/ComingSoon.tsx`)
- Three variants: full, inline, banner
- Displays user-friendly "Coming Soon" messages
- Includes badges for navigation items
- Estimated dates for feature completion

### 3. Updated Campaigns Page (`/app/campaigns/page.tsx`)
- Added feature flag checks for:
  - Campaign creation (disabled)
  - Campaign analytics (disabled)
  - View/Edit actions (disabled)
- Shows "Coming Soon" banner when features are disabled
- Toast notifications for disabled actions

### 4. Updated Surveys Page (`/app/surveys/page.tsx`)
- Added feature flag checks for:
  - Survey creation (disabled)
  - Survey responses viewing (disabled)
  - Survey analytics (disabled)
  - Edit/Delete/Send actions (disabled)
- Shows "Coming Soon" messages for disabled sections
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Navigation Updates (`/app/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`)

- Marketing and Surveys items marked with badges
- Visual indication of features in development

### 6. Toast Notifications (`/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added react-hot-toast Toaster component
- Dark theme configuration
- Success and error styling
- Top-right positioning

## Feature Flag Status

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `campaigns` | ✅ Enabled | Shows in navigation |
| `campaignsCreate` | ❌ Disabled | Creation functionality disabled |
| `campaignsAnalytics` | ❌ Disabled | Analytics tab shows "Coming Soon" |
| `campaignsActions` | ❌ Disabled | View/Edit buttons disabled |
| `surveys` | ✅ Enabled | Shows in navigation |
| `surveysCreate` | ❌ Disabled | Creation functionality disabled |
| `surveysResponses` | ❌ Disabled | Responses are mock only |
| `surveysAnalytics` | ❌ Disabled | Analytics tab shows "Coming Soon" |
| `surveysActions` | ❌ Disabled | Edit/Delete/Send buttons disabled |

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Communication**: Users see "Coming Soon" messages instead of broken features
2. **Toast Feedback**: Immediate feedback when clicking disabled features
3. **Visual Indicators**: Navigation badges show which features are incomplete
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Features are visible but properly disabled
5. **Development Mode**: Can be overridden with environment variables for testing

## Environment Variable Overrides

To enable all campaign features in development:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CAMPAIGNS=true
```

To enable all survey features in development:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_SURVEYS=true
```

## Testing

The feature flags can be tested by:
1. Navigating to `/campaigns` - should see banner about limited functionality
2. Clicking "Create Campaign" - should see "Coming Soon" page
3. Clicking View/Edit buttons - should see toast notifications
4. Navigating to `/surveys` - similar behavior as campaigns
5. Checking navigation sidebar - should see "SOON" badges

## Future Considerations

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Can enable features for specific users/organizations
2. **A/B Testing**: Use flags for testing new features with subsets of users
3. **Remote Configuration**: Could integrate with LaunchDarkly or similar services
4. **Analytics**: Track which "Coming Soon" features users try to access most

## Impact

- **Development Friendly**: Easy to enable/disable features during development
- **Production Ready**: Safe to deploy immediately
