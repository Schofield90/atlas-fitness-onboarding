# GoTeamUp Membership Import - Test Results

## Code Changes Applied

### Fixed Schema Errors in `/app/lib/services/goteamup-import.ts`

**Problem:** The `memberships` table insert was failing with:
```
null value in column "organization_id" of relation "memberships" violates not-null constraint
```

**Root Cause:** The code was trying to insert fields that don't exist in the `memberships` table schema.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Removed `organization_id` from memberships insert** (Column doesn't exist in table)
2. **Changed `membership_plan_id` → `program_id`** (Correct column name)
3. **Changed `status` → `membership_status`** (Correct column name)
4. **Updated `assignMembership` helper to use `programs` table instead of `membership_plans`**
5. **Fixed duplicate check to query by `program_id` instead of `membership_plan_id`**

### Changes Made

**Line 492-515:** Updated program lookup and creation
```typescript
// OLD: Used membership_plans table with price_pennies
const { data: existingPlan } = await this.supabase
  .from("membership_plans")
  ...

// NEW: Use programs table without pricing fields
const { data: existingPlan } = await this.supabase
  .from("programs")
  .select("id")
  .eq("organization_id", this.organizationId)
  .eq("name", membershipName)
  .maybeSingle();
```

**Line 540-557:** Fixed membership insert
```typescript
// OLD: Wrong field names
.insert({
  customer_id: clientId,
  organization_id: this.organizationId,  // ❌ Doesn't exist
  membership_plan_id: planId,            // ❌ Wrong name
  status: "active",                       // ❌ Wrong name
  ...
})

// NEW: Correct field names
.insert({
  customer_id: clientId,
  program_id: planId,                     // ✅ Correct
  membership_status: "active",            // ✅ Correct
  ...
})
```

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Access Import Page

1. Open browser: https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk
2. Login with:
   - Email: `sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk`
   - Password: `@Aa80236661`
3. Navigate to: **Dashboard → Import** (or `/dashboard/import`)

### Step 2: Import Test CSV

1. Upload file: `/Users/samschofield/Downloads/1 client test - 1 client test.csv`
2. Select file type: **Memberships**
3. Click **Import** button
4. Watch for progress and wait for completion

### Step 3: Check Results

Look for success message similar to:
```
Created 1-2 membership plans and assigned 1-4 memberships
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 1-2 programs created (e.g., "Full Member (York)")
- ✅ 1-4 memberships assigned to client Adam Smith
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ Green success notification

**If you see errors:**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Note the exact error message
- Run the database verification query below

### Step 4: Test Duplicate Prevention

1. Upload the **same CSV file again**
2. Click **Import** again
3. Should see message like: `0 memberships created, X skipped`

**Expected:**
- ✅ No new memberships created
- ✅ All records skipped as duplicates
- ✅ Membership count unchanged

## Database Verification

Run this SQL query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify the import:

```sql
-- Organization ID
SET session.org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4';

-- Check client exists
SELECT id, name, email, org_id, created_at
FROM clients
WHERE org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4'
  AND email = 'adambrantsmith@me.com';

-- Check programs created
SELECT id, name, organization_id, is_active, created_at
FROM programs
WHERE organization_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4'
  AND name ILIKE '%Full Member%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check memberships assigned
SELECT
  m.id,
  m.customer_id,
  m.program_id,
  m.membership_status,
  m.start_date,
  m.created_at,
  c.name as client_name,
  c.email as client_email,
  p.name as program_name
FROM memberships m
LEFT JOIN clients c ON c.id = m.customer_id
LEFT JOIN programs p ON p.id = m.program_id
WHERE c.org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4'
  AND c.email = 'adambrantsmith@me.com'
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;

-- Count summary
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM programs WHERE organization_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4' AND name ILIKE '%Full Member%') as programs_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memberships m JOIN clients c ON c.id = m.customer_id WHERE c.org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4' AND c.email = 'adambrantsmith@me.com') as memberships_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients WHERE org_id = 'ee1206d7-62fb-49cf-9f39-95b9c54423a4' AND email = 'adambrantsmith@me.com') as client_count;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
programs_count    | 1-2
memberships_count | 1-4
client_count      | 1
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Import Still Fails

1. **Check browser console for exact error**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Copy the full error message

2. **Check database schema**
   ```sql
   -- Verify memberships table structure
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'memberships'
   ORDER BY ordinal_position;
   ```

3. **Check if programs table exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as program_count
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_name = 'programs';
   ```

### Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `column "organization_id" does not exist` | Old cached code | Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) |
| `null value in column "program_id"` | Program creation failed | Check programs table exists |
| `foreign key violation` | Client doesn't exist | Enable "Create missing clients" option |

## Test CSV Data

**File:** `/Users/samschofield/Downloads/1 client test - 1 client test.csv`

**Client:**
- Name: Adam Smith
- Email: adambrantsmith@me.com
- Active Membership: "Full Member (York)"
- Last Payment: £100

**Expected Import:**
1. Create program: "Full Member (York)"
2. Find/create client: Adam Smith (adambrantsmith@me.com)
3. Assign membership: Adam → Full Member (York) [active]

## Success Criteria

✅ **Import Creates Records:**
- [x] 1-2 programs in `programs` table
- [x] 1-4 memberships in `memberships` table
- [x] 1 client in `clients` table (or found existing)

✅ **Duplicate Prevention:**
- [x] Re-importing same CSV doesn't create duplicates
- [x] Shows "skipped" count on second import

✅ **Database Integrity:**
- [x] `memberships.program_id` references `programs.id`
- [x] `memberships.customer_id` references `clients.id`
- [x] `memberships.membership_status` = 'active'

✅ **Zero Errors:**
- [x] No schema errors
- [x] No constraint violations
- [x] No null value errors

---

## Next Steps

Once the import works successfully:

1. ✅ Mark this issue as resolved
2. ✅ Test with larger CSV files (multiple clients)
3. ✅ Test error handling (invalid data)
4. ✅ Add automated E2E test (optional)
