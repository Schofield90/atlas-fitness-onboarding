# Manual Sales Call Processing Workflow

Since the GHL API isn't responding, here's how to manually process your sales calls:

## Option 1: Manual Export from GHL
1. Go to your GHL dashboard
2. Navigate to the Calls section
3. Export/download your call recordings
4. Save them to the `audio_files` folder
5. Run the transcription: `python3 sales_call_transcriber.py`

## Option 2: Use Existing Recordings
If you already have call recordings saved:
1. Copy them to the `audio_files` folder
2. Run: `python3 example_usage.py`

## Option 3: Record Future Calls
For new calls, you can:
1. Use call recording software during calls
2. Save recordings with descriptive names
3. Process them with our transcription system

## Transcription Results
Your transcribed calls will include:
- ✅ Full conversation text
- ✅ Speaker identification (you vs customer)
- ✅ Timestamps for each section
- ✅ JSON format perfect for AI training

## Next Steps for GHL API
1. Contact GHL support for current API documentation
2. Ask about call recording API access requirements
3. Verify your API key has the right permissions

The transcription system is ready - we just need the audio files!
