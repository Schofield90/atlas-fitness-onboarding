   - **Timeline**: Fix planned for next iteration

2. **Toast Notifications**
   - **Issue**: Temporarily simplified for SSR compatibility
   - **Impact**: Limited toast functionality in some scenarios
   - **Monitoring**: Check for user feedback on notifications
   - **Timeline**: Enhanced implementation planned

3. **Test Credentials**
   - **Issue**: Limited test user accounts for E2E testing
   - **Impact**: Cannot test all authenticated features comprehensively
   - **Monitoring**: Manual testing required for some features
   - **Timeline**: Test account creation in progress

### Future Monitoring

#### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] **Performance metrics review**
- [ ] **User feedback analysis**
- [ ] **Error rate trends**
- [ ] **Feature usage analytics**

#### Monthly Reviews
