# TeamUp PDF Import - QA Test Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Tester:** Claude (QA Agent)
**Test Type:** End-to-End Automated + Manual Verification
**Environment:** Production (login.gymleadhub.co.uk)
**Test Credentials:** sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk
**Test PDF:** /Users/samschofield/Downloads/TeamUp.pdf (305KB)

## Executive Summary

### OVERALL STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIAL FAILURE

The TeamUp PDF import feature successfully:
- ✅ Uploads PDF files
- ✅ Analyzes PDFs using Claude AI (Anthropic)
- ✅ Extracts class schedule data from PDFs
- ⚠️ **FAILS to import classes due to database schema mismatch**

### Critical Issue Found

**Database Schema Error**: The import endpoint attempts to insert into `class_schedules` table with a `title` column that does not exist in the schema cache.

**Impact**:
- 0 classes imported despite 12 classes extracted
- 100% import failure rate
- Users see "Import Complete" but no data persists

## Code Review Findings

### File Structure

```
app/settings/integrations/teamup/page.tsx
app/api/classes/import/teamup-pdf/
├── upload/route.ts
├── analyze/route.ts
└── import/route.ts
```

### Security Analysis ✅

#### 1. Organization Isolation - PASS
**All API routes use `requireAuth()` to get organization dynamically:**

```typescript
// upload/route.ts
const user = await requireAuth();
const organizationId = user.organizationId;

// analyze/route.ts
const user = await requireAuth();
// (organizationId from user context)

// import/route.ts
const user = await requireAuth();
const organizationId = user.organizationId;
```

✅ **No hard-coded organization IDs found**

#### 2. Multi-Tenant Safety - PASS
- All database inserts include `organization_id` from authenticated user
- Uses `createAdminClient()` with service role key (appropriate for server-side operations)
- No gym-specific logic (e.g., "Atlas Fitness", "York" hardcoded)

#### 3. Hard-Coded Values - MINOR ISSUE
**Found in `analyze/route.ts` (AI prompt):**

```typescript
- If you see "[YO]" in the class name, location is "York"
- If you see "[HG]" in the class name, location is "Harrogate"
```

**Assessment**: This is only in the AI prompt as an EXAMPLE. The AI still extracts actual location data from the PDF. However, it may bias the AI to expect York/Harrogate in all PDFs.

**Recommendation**: Make prompt more generic:
```typescript
- Extract location from class title indicators (e.g., "[LOC]" prefix)
- If location codes are present, extract the actual location name
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Schema Mismatch

**File:** `/Users/samschofield/atlas-fitness-onboarding/app/api/classes/import/teamup-pdf/import/route.ts`

**Line 163-168:**
```typescript
const { error: scheduleError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from("class_schedules")
  .insert({
    class_type_id: classTypeId,
    title: classData.name,  // ❌ Column 'title' does not exist
    start_time: startDateTime.toISOString(),
    end_time: endDateTime.toISOString(),
    instructor_name: classData.instructor || null,
    room_location: classData.location || "Unknown",
  });
```

**Issue**: The code attempts to insert `title` into `class_schedules` table, but the schema cache indicates this column doesn't exist.

**Possible Causes:**
1. Schema migration not applied
2. Column name mismatch (might be `name` or `session_name` instead of `title`)
3. Schema cache out of sync with actual database

**Solution Required:**
1. Check actual `class_schedules` table schema in Supabase
2. Update insert statement to match actual column names
3. Consider adding schema validation before import

## AI Extraction Quality Assessment

### Extraction Coverage: 30% ⚠️

**Expected:** 40+ classes (all morning AND evening slots)
**Actual:** 12 classes (only morning slots 6-8am)

**Missing Data:**
- ❌ No 6:00 PM classes extracted
- ❌ No 7:00 PM classes extracted
- ❌ Likely missing weekend afternoon classes
- ❌ Possibly missing other weekday time slots

### Time Slot Analysis

| Time Slot | Expected | Found | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 6:00 AM | ✅ | ✅ | PASS |
| 7:00 AM | ✅ | ✅ | PASS |
| 6:00 PM | ✅ | ❌ | FAIL |
| 7:00 PM | ✅ | ❌ | FAIL |

**Hypothesis**: The AI prompt may not emphasize extracting ALL pages or ALL time slots. The PDF may have multiple pages with different time periods.

**Recommendation**: Update AI prompt to explicitly request:
```typescript
CRITICAL: Scan ALL pages of the PDF, not just the first page.
Extract EVERY time slot including:
- Early morning (5am-9am)
- Mid-day (9am-5pm)
- Evening (5pm-10pm)
- Weekend schedules

Do NOT stop after the first page. Continue scanning until all pages are processed.
```

## Multi-Tenant Readiness: 85% ✅

### Strengths
1. ✅ Dynamic organization context via `requireAuth()`
2. ✅ No hard-coded organization IDs
3. ✅ Service role key properly secured server-side
4. ✅ All database operations scoped to user's organization
5. ✅ Generic class extraction (no gym-specific assumptions)

### Weaknesses
1. ⚠️ AI prompt contains York/Harrogate location examples (may bias results)
2. ⚠️ No validation that PDF format matches expected TeamUp format
3. ⚠️ No handling for different PDF structures (multi-page, different layouts)

### Would This Work for 100+ Gyms?

**Answer: YES, with fixes**

The architecture is sound for multi-tenant use:
- Organization isolation is properly implemented
- No hard-coded gym data in import logic
- Generic enough to handle different class names, instructors, locations

**Required Fixes:**
1. Fix database schema mismatch (critical)
2. Improve AI prompt for complete extraction (high priority)
3. Remove location-specific examples from prompt (medium priority)
4. Add PDF format validation (low priority)

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL (P0) - Must Fix Before Production Use
1. **Fix Database Schema Mismatch**
   - Investigate `class_schedules` table schema
   - Update insert statement in `import/route.ts:163-168`
   - Add schema validation before import
   - Test with successful import

### HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Affects User Experience
2. **Improve AI Extraction Coverage**
   - Update AI prompt to scan ALL pages
   - Explicitly request morning AND evening slots
   - Add validation that all expected time slots are extracted
   - Target: 40+ classes extracted from sample PDF

3. **Add User Feedback for Failures**
   - Import shows "Success" even with 0 imports
   - Should show clear error when database insert fails
   - Suggest retry or contact support

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2) - Improve Robustness
4. **Remove Location-Specific AI Prompt Examples**
   - Replace "York" and "Harrogate" examples with generic placeholders
   - Test with PDFs from different gyms/locations
   - Ensure AI doesn't assume UK location codes

5. **Add PDF Format Validation**
   - Detect if PDF is actually from TeamUp
   - Warn user if PDF format doesn't match expected structure
   - Provide guidance on exporting correct PDF from TeamUp

### LOW PRIORITY (P3) - Nice to Have
6. **Add Progress Indicators**
   - Show AI analysis progress (e.g., "Processing page 1 of 3")
   - Show import progress (e.g., "Imported 5 of 12 classes")

7. **Add Duplicate Detection**
   - Check if classes already exist before import
   - Offer to skip or update existing classes

---

## Conclusion

The TeamUp PDF import feature demonstrates solid architecture and multi-tenant design, but has a **critical database schema bug** that prevents any imports from succeeding. Additionally, the AI extraction is only capturing ~30% of expected classes (missing evening slots).

**Deployment Status**: ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Estimated Fix Time:**
- Database schema fix: 1-2 hours (investigate + fix + test)
- AI prompt improvements: 30-60 minutes (update prompt + test)
- Total: 2-3 hours to production-ready

**Test Confidence**:
- Code Quality: 8/10 (well-structured, secure, multi-tenant safe)
- Functionality: 3/10 (uploads work, AI works, but import fails)
- User Experience: 4/10 (shows success when actually failed)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Investigate `class_schedules` table schema in Supabase
2. **Immediate**: Fix column name mismatch in import endpoint
3. **Short-term**: Re-run import test to verify fix
4. **Short-term**: Update AI prompt for better extraction
5. **Medium-term**: Add comprehensive error handling
6. **Long-term**: Test with PDFs from multiple gyms
