# Deployment Log

## 2025-09-26 - Members Loading Fix

### Issue

- Members tab in CRM was stuck on "Loading members..."
- API endpoints were timing out due to server compilation errors

### Root Cause

- Server compilation errors: "Cannot redefine property: \_\_import_unsupported"
- Middleware compilation issues preventing proper API execution
- Recursive turbo invocations blocking server startup

### Resolution

- Fixed server compilation errors by clean restart
- Verified API endpoints working correctly
- Confirmed 2 active members loading: Wayne Field & Sam Schofield
- Both members have active test memberships

### Verification

- ✅ Server running cleanly on port 3001
- ✅ Members API returning 200 status with 2 members
- ✅ Organization context working properly
- ✅ Database relationships correct

### Deployment

Members should now display correctly in production after this deployment.
