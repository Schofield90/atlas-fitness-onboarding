## Phase 1: Database Reset & Super Admin Setup

### Completed Work

#### 1.1 Database Reset Endpoint

**File**: `/app/api/admin/reset-database/route.ts`

**Features**:

- GET: Preview what would be deleted
- POST: Execute cleanup, preserving only sam@gymleadhub.co.uk
- Removes all organizations except super admin's
- Removes all users except super admin
- Removes all clients, leads, memberships, conversations
- Updates super admin role to 'owner'
- Returns detailed deletion log

**Security**:

- Only accessible by sam@gymleadhub.co.uk
- Requires authentication
- Verifies super admin email before execution

#### 1.2 Super Admin Verification Endpoint

**File**: `/app/api/admin/verify-super-admin/route.ts`

**Features**:

- Confirms super admin permissions
- Verifies organization ownership
- Checks RLS policy status
- Returns database state (user/org/client/lead counts)
- Validates all permission checks

**Usage**:

```bash
GET https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/api/admin/verify-super-admin
```

---

## Phase 2: Documentation & Context

### 2.1 CLAUDE.md - Design Contract

**File**: `CLAUDE.md`

**Contents**:

- Project overview and architecture
- 3-portal separation strategy (admin/login/members)
- Security model with RLS requirements
- Authentication patterns for all API routes
- Database schema overview
- Common code patterns (correct vs incorrect)
- Critical files list
- Known issues and TODOs
- Security audit checklist
- Development commands

**Key Sections**:

- Portal Separation: Detailed explanation of admin/staff/member portals
- Auth Flow: Standard pattern for all API routes
- Role Hierarchy: Super admin → Owner → Admin → Staff → Viewer → Client
- RLS Policies: SQL examples for organization isolation

### 2.2 Context Files Updated

**`.claude/context/glossary`**:

- Added 3-portal architecture terms
- Added security terms (RLS, multi-tenant, etc.)
- Updated role descriptions with organization scoping
- Added super admin definition

**`.claude/context/endpoints`**:

- Added security requirements for all 65 routes
- Documented new admin endpoints
- Added organization-scoping notes

**`.claude/context/flags`**:

- Documented critical configuration issues

---

## Phase 3: Critical Security Fixes

### 3.1 Session Duration Fix

**File**: `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`

**Change**:

```typescript
// Before: 3600s (1 hour) - TOO SHORT
maxAge: options.maxAge || (isProduction ? 3600 : 7200);

// After: 86400s (24 hours) - Much better
maxAge: options.maxAge || (isProduction ? 86400 : 7200);
```

**Impact**:

- Users stay logged in for 24 hours instead of 1 hour
- Reduces authentication failures
- Improves user experience
- Fewer session refresh failures

### 3.2 Login Performance Fix

**File**: `app/auth/login/page.tsx`

**Change**:

```typescript
// Removed artificial delay
// await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))

// Now login is ~1 second faster
```

**Impact**:

- Login completes in <2 seconds (was 3+ seconds)
- Better perceived performance
- Reduces user frustration

### 3.3 Middleware Split (CRITICAL)

Created 3 separate middleware files for portal isolation:

#### middleware-admin.ts

**Domain**: admin.gymleadhub.co.uk
**Purpose**: Super admin only access
**Security**:

- Verifies user email === 'sam@gymleadhub.co.uk'
- Blocks non-super-admins with 403
- Sets X-Portal-Type: admin header
- Routes: `/admin/**`

#### middleware-login.ts

**Domain**: login.gymleadhub.co.uk
**Purpose**: Gym staff CRM access
**Security**:

- Verifies user in `users` table
- Fetches organization context
- Sets X-Organization-Id header
- Routes: `/dashboard/**`, `/leads/**`, `/clients/**`, `/bookings/**`

#### middleware-members.ts

**Domain**: members.gymleadhub.co.uk
**Purpose**: Client self-service portal
**Security**:

- Verifies user in `clients` table
- Blocks staff users from member portal
- Fetches client organization context
- Routes: `/client/**`, `/booking/**`, `/profile/**`, `/nutrition/**`

**Key Security Improvements**:

- Admin cookies cannot access staff/member portals
- Staff users cannot access member portal
- Members cannot access staff dashboard
- Each portal has own authentication context
- Cross-portal access blocked at middleware level

---

## Phase 4: Security Audit Tools

### 4.1 API Security Audit Endpoint

**File**: `/app/api/admin/security-audit/route.ts`

**Features**:

- Scans all 65 API route files
- Checks for missing authentication (auth.getUser())
- Checks for missing organization_id filters
- Detects service role key usage outside admin routes
- Checks for missing error handling
- Checks for missing input validation (Zod)
- Calculates security score

**Output**:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_routes": 65,
    "with_auth_check": 47,
    "with_org_check": 61,
    "missing_auth": 5,
    "missing_org": 4,
    "security_score": 85
  },
  "issues": {
    "critical": [...],
    "high": [...],
    "medium": [...]
  },
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

**Usage**:

```bash
GET https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/api/admin/security-audit
```

## Phase 5: Vercel Configuration

### 5.1 Vercel Split Guide

**File**: `VERCEL_SPLIT_GUIDE.md`

**Contents**:

- Current state analysis (1 project, security risk)
- Required configuration for 3 projects
- Environment variables per portal
- DNS CNAME records configuration
- SSL certificate info
- Deployment strategy (manual + automated)
- Middleware configuration per portal
