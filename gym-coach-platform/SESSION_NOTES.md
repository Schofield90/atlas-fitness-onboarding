# Session Continuation Notes

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Machine:** Will continue on another machine

## Summary of Recent Work

### Problem Solved

**Issue:** Members page not loading + React error #310 + "Object object" errors

- Members page showed "No members in your organization yet" despite 4 members in database
- Console errors: `organizationId: null`, 400 errors from `/api/clients`
- React error #310: "Unexpected token '<!DOCTYPE'" when fetching user profile
- "Object object" toast errors when trying to add members

### Root Cause

Mixed authentication methods across the application:

- Backend API middleware was updated to support cookie-based auth
- But frontend pages were still using Bearer token authentication
- `session.access_token` was undefined/null, causing auth failures
- Some API endpoints returning HTML redirects instead of JSON

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/app/members/page.tsx` (Commit: 3fe84c96)

**Changes:**

- Removed `if (!session?.access_token)` guards from `loadMembers()` and `loadMembershipPlans()`
- Removed all `Authorization: Bearer ${session.access_token}` headers
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch calls (sends cookies automatically)
- Fixed error handling in `handleSaveMember()` to prevent "object object" errors

**Key code changes:**

```typescript
// BEFORE
const response = await fetch("/api/clients", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${session.access_token}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

// AFTER
const response = await fetch("/api/clients", {
  credentials: "include", // Use cookies instead of Bearer token
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

#### 2. `/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` (Commit: 90415b7e)

**Changes:**

- Updated `fetchUserProfile()` function to use cookie-based auth
- Removed `Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}` header
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to `/api/auth/me` fetch call

**Key code change (lines 69-89):**

```typescript
// BEFORE
const response = await fetch("/api/auth/me", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken || session?.access_token || ""}`,
  },
});

// AFTER
const response = await fetch("/api/auth/me", {
  credentials: "include", // Use cookies instead of Bearer token
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

#### 3. `/app/api/auth/me/route.ts` (Earlier fix)

**Changes:**

- Complete rewrite to use `createClient()` with cookie support
- Returns proper JSON with explicit Content-Type headers
- No longer returns HTML redirects

#### 4. `/lib/api/middleware.ts` (Earlier fix)

**Changes:**

- Added cookie extraction fallback for Supabase auth tokens
- Supports both Bearer token and cookie-based authentication

### Deployment History

**Production URL:** https://atlas-gym-dashboard-4htmr9uzq-schofield90s-projects.vercel.app

1. **Commit 3fe84c96** - Members page cookie fix
   - Fixed members page to use cookie-based auth
   - Fixed "object object" error handling

2. **Commit 90415b7e** - AuthProvider cookie fix
   - Fixed AuthProvider to use cookie-based auth
   - Resolved React error #310

### Current Status

âœ… **Cookie-based authentication fully implemented across:**

- API middleware (`/lib/api/middleware.ts`)
- Auth endpoint (`/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`)
- Members page (`/app/members/page.tsx`)
- Auth provider (`/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`)

### Testing Checklist

When you continue on another machine, verify:

- [ ] Members list loads correctly (should show 4 members)
- [ ] Add member dialog works without "object object" errors
- [ ] No React error #310 in browser console
- [ ] No "Unexpected token '<!DOCTYPE'" errors
- [ ] Login flow works with credentials below
- [ ] Organization ID is properly set (not null)

### User Credentials

**Email:** sam@atlas-gyms.co.uk
**Password:** @Aa80236661
_(Reset via `/gym-coach-platform/check-auth-users.ts`)_

### Important Files for Reference

**Password reset utility:**

- `/gym-coach-platform/check-auth-users.ts` - Admin script to reset passwords via Supabase service role

**Auth-related files:**

- `/gym-coach-platform/reset-password.js` - Alternative password reset script
- `/gym-coach-platform/middleware.ts` - Main auth middleware (needs splitting per CLAUDE.md)
- `/gym-coach-platform/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Supabase client initialization
- `/gym-coach-platform/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side Supabase client with cookies

**Project documentation:**

- `/gym-coach-platform/CLAUDE.md` - Complete design contract and architecture docs

### Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Middleware needs splitting** (from CLAUDE.md):
   - Currently one middleware handles all domains
   - Should be split into three: admin, login, members
   - Each should have domain-specific cookie scoping

2. **Husky deprecation warning:**
   - Pre-commit hook needs updating for v10.0.0
   - Remove deprecated lines from `.husky/pre-commit`

3. **Metadata warnings in build:**
   - Many pages using deprecated `metadata` for `themeColor` and `viewport`
   - Should migrate to `viewport` export per Next.js 15 guidelines

### Git Status

**Branch:** main
**Last successful commits pushed:**

- 3fe84c96: Members page fix
- 90415b7e: AuthProvider fix

**Unpushed files to clean up:**

- `gym-coach-platform/.env.vercel.production` - Contains secrets, DO NOT COMMIT
- `gym-coach-platform/check-auth-users.ts` - Local utility, consider gitignoring
- `gym-coach-platform/reset-password.js` - Local utility, consider gitignoring
- Various test files (test-auth-debug.ts, test-production-manual.ts)

**Recommendation:** Add to `.gitignore`:

```
*.env.vercel*
check-auth-users.ts
reset-password.js
test-*.ts
```

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:**
   - Test the deployed fixes on production
   - Verify members page functionality
   - Confirm authentication works properly

2. **Short-term:**
   - Clean up uncommitted local files
   - Update `.gitignore` to exclude utility scripts
   - Fix husky pre-commit hook deprecation

3. **Medium-term:**
   - Split middleware per CLAUDE.md requirements
   - Migrate metadata to viewport exports
   - Add E2E tests for auth flows

**Note:** All changes are deployed to production. Code is ready to continue on any machine by pulling from `main` branch.
