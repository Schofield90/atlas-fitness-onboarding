# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `@radix-ui/react-slider` was missing from package.json
**Solution**: Added the dependency with `npm install @radix-ui/react-slider`

### 2. Import Errors in API Routes
**Problem**: Several API routes were importing non-existent functions:
- `validateApiRequest` from `@/lib/api/middleware` (doesn't exist)
- `supabase` from `@/lib/supabase/server` (doesn't exist)

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/api/leads/import/route.ts`
- `app/api/leads/export/route.ts`

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `validateApiRequest` with `authenticateRequest` and `createApiResponse`
- Replaced `supabase` import with `createClient` function
- Updated variable references from `organization.id` to `user.organization_id`

### 3. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Build was failing due to missing required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`

**Solution**: 
- Created `.env.local` with placeholder values for build time
- Modified `app/api/email/send/route.ts` to handle missing Resend API key gracefully
- Added runtime checks to prevent actual API calls with placeholder keys

### 4. Multiple Lockfiles Warning
**Problem**: Both `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` existed
**Solution**: Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` to use npm as the primary package manager

## Environment Variables Setup

For production deployment, you need to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# Required Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Email Service (Optional - for email functionality)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Other service keys as needed for your features
```

## Build Status
‚úÖ **Build now succeeds** - All compilation errors resolved
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings present** - Metadata configuration warnings (non-blocking)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Set proper environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Run database migration: `npx supabase migration up` (for messaging feature)
3. Configure actual service API keys (Resend, etc.)
4. Test all functionality in production environment

## Files Modified
- `app/api/leads/import/route.ts` - Fixed imports and authentication
- `app/api/leads/export/route.ts` - Fixed imports and authentication  
- `app/api/email/send/route.ts` - Added graceful handling of missing API key
- `.env.local` - Added placeholder environment variables
- `package.json` - Added missing `@radix-ui/react-slider` dependency
- Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` to avoid lockfile conflicts

The deployment should now work successfully on Vercel! üöÄ
