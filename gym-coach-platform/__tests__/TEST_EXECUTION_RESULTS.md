# Member Management E2E Test Execution Results

## Test Suite Information

**Test File:** `__tests__/e2e/member-management-production.spec.ts`
**Target Environment:** https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk (Production)
**Test Created:** 2025-09-30
**Purpose:** Verify fix for "Organization not found" errors in member management

---

## Bug Context

**Issue Fixed:** 6 API routes were querying wrong database table (`profiles` → `users`)

**Affected Routes:**

1. `/api/clients` (GET, POST)
2. `/api/clients/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
3. `/api/clients/[id]/assign-waiver` (POST)
4. `/api/clients/[id]/send-welcome-email` (POST)
5. `/api/client/body-composition` (POST)

**Expected Fix:** All routes should now query `users` table for `organization_id`, preventing "Organization not found" errors.

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria ✅

For the bug fix to be considered successful:

1. **No "Organization not found" errors** in any test
2. **All API routes return correct status codes**
   - 200 OK for valid requests
   - 401 Unauthorized for missing auth
   - 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
   - 404 Not Found for invalid resources
3. **Member operations work correctly**
4. **Data is properly scoped to organization**
5. **Permission checks enforce role-based access**

### Acceptable Warnings ⚠️

These don't indicate bugs:

- Feature not implemented (e.g., body composition form)
- Staff user cannot delete (expected)
- Invalid member ID returns 404 (expected)

### Critical Failures ❌

These indicate the bug is NOT fixed:

- Any "Organization not found" error
- API returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Members page doesn't load for authenticated users
- Valid operations fail with 401/404

## Manual Verification Steps

If automated tests cannot be run, perform these manual checks:

### 1. Login Test

1. Go to https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/auth/login
2. Login with owner credentials
3. ✅ Should redirect to /dashboard
4. ❌ If stuck on login or error appears, login is broken

### 2. Members Page Test

1. Navigate to https://login.gymleadhub.co.uk/members
2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
3. Check GET `/api/clients` request
4. ✅ Should return 200 OK with member data
5. ❌ If "Organization not found" appears, bug is NOT fixed

### 3. Member Deletion Test

1. Click delete on a test member
2. In DevTools Network tab, find DELETE `/api/clients/[id]` request
3. ✅ Should return 200 OK
4. ❌ If "Organization not found" error, bug is NOT fixed
5. ✅ Member should disappear from list

### 4. Permission Test

1. Login as staff user (not owner/admin)
2. Try to delete a member
3. ✅ Should see "Insufficient permissions" or button hidden
4. ❌ If staff can delete, permissions are broken

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Cannot find module 'dotenv'

**Fix:**

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### Error: Browser not installed

**Fix:**

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Error: Invalid credentials

**Fix:**

1. Verify credentials in `.env.test.production`
2. Test credentials manually in browser
3. Update if password changed

### Error: Timeout waiting for page load

**Fix:**

1. Check production site is accessible
2. Increase timeout in `playwright-production.config.ts`:

```typescript
use: {
  navigationTimeout: 60000, // 60 seconds
}
```

### Error: "Organization not found" still appears

**This means the bug is NOT fixed!**

**Action Required:**

1. Note which API route is failing
2. Check the route implementation
3. Verify it queries `users` table, not `profiles`
4. Ensure `organization_id` is correctly fetched
5. Re-deploy and re-test

## Next Steps

### After Running Tests

1. **If All Pass ✅:**
   - Document results in this file

2. **If Some Fail ❌:**
   - Review failure screenshots
   - Check error messages
   - Identify which routes still have issues
   - Fix the issues
   - Re-run tests

3. **If Tests Cannot Run ⚠️:**
   - Perform manual verification
