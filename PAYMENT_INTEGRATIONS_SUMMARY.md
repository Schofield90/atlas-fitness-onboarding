## Key Features

### Auto-Create Archived Clients

When importing payments/charges, if customer doesn't exist in CRM:

- Fetches customer details from provider API
- Creates client with `status='archived'`
- Links payment to archived client
- **Benefit**: Complete historical revenue data

### Auto-Create Membership Plans

When importing subscriptions:

- Extracts unique prices/amounts
- Creates membership plans automatically
- Links via `provider_price_id`
- **Benefit**: No manual plan setup needed

### Duplicate Prevention

- Checks existing payments by `provider_payment_id`
- Checks existing memberships by `client_id` + `plan_id`
- Updates instead of creating duplicates
